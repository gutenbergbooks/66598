<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright examples
to the imitation of the youthful soldier, and
thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct
of those who have preceded him in their honorable
career, are among the motives that have given rise
to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the
Commanders, and the Officers and Troops acting
under their orders, expressions of approbation and
of thanks for their skill and bravery; and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their
Sovereign’s approbation, constitute the reward
which the soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the Official Reports made by the respective
Commanders, ample justice has generally been done
to the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General’s Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and
surprising, gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to ensure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have
the welfare of their country at heart, the records
of the several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

Queen Anne. The Marine corps were embarked in the Fleet under

<p>In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards

of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January, 1809, it is stated:&mdash;“On
no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves; and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.”</p>

<p>Charles II., King of Spain, being affected with a
dangerous indisposition, the European powers, in order
to prevent the contention which was expected to arise
on the decease of that monarch, determined to divide
the Spanish territories among the several competitors.
The first “<em>Partition Treaty</em>” was concluded between
France, England, and Holland, on the 29th of August
1698; but a second Treaty was rendered necessary, in
consequence of the death of the Electoral Prince of
Bavaria, who had been declared heir to the Spanish
Crown; accordingly, on the 15th of March 1700, a
second Treaty was entered into between the same contracting
powers, by which it was arranged that Charles
Archduke of Austria, the second son of Leopold Emperor
of Germany, should succeed to the throne of Spain,
a certain portion of the territories of that Kingdom
being, as before, allotted to the Dauphin of France;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
and the Duke of Lorrain was to receive Milan in exchange
for his own country, which was to be given to
the French nation.</p>

<p>The long expected demise of the King of Spain
occurred on the 1st of November 1700; and that Sovereign,
incensed at the dismemberment of his dominions,
bequeathed the Spanish monarchy to Philip Duke
of Anjou, second son of the Dauphin of France; and
Louis XIV., disregarding the treaties to which he had
been a party, determined to support his grandson’s
accession to the throne of Spain.</p>

<p>The French at this period overran the Spanish
Netherlands and seized several strong towns, partly
garrisoned by the Dutch, which compelled the States
of Holland to acknowledge the Duke of Anjou’s title,
with a view of obtaining their soldiers, who were not
permitted to return, without difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701.</div>

<p>It is a singular circumstance of the time, that King
William, seeing the unwillingness of the nation to
engage in a fresh war, actually acknowledged the
Duke of Anjou as King of Spain, and sent him a
letter of congratulation. In May 1701, however, the
House of Commons unanimously resolved to assist the
Dutch, and provide succours for the States General, in
order to maintain the liberties of Europe. Several
regiments were in the following month embarked for
Holland; and additions were also made to the army
and navy.</p>

<p>On the 28th of June 1701 a Royal Warrant was
issued authorizing William Viscount Charlemont to
raise a regiment in Ireland, which was afterwards
numbered the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>.</p>

<p>England might have abstained from open hostilities
with France had it not been for the following circumstance:&mdash;In
the midst of these preparations the
decease of James II. occurred at St. Germains on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
16th of September 1701, and his son, the titular
Prince of Wales, was immediately proclaimed, by
order of Louis XIV., as King of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, by the title of King James III. This
indignity to the British Sovereign and Nation, added to
the contemplated union of the crowns of France and
Spain, made war inevitable; and King William, with
the Emperor of Austria and the States General, concluded
“<em>the Grand Alliance</em>,” the principal objects of
which were to procure the Spanish Netherlands as a
barrier for the Dutch, and to prevent France and Spain
becoming eventually under the sway of the same
Prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702.</div>

<p>War was thus on the eve of being proclaimed, when
King William met with the accident which terminated
in his decease on the 8th of March 1702; the accession
of Queen Anne, however, caused no alteration in the
policy of her predecessor; and war was declared against
France and Spain on the 4th of May following; additional
forces were sent to Flanders, and the Earl of
Marlborough was appointed to command the British,
Dutch, and auxiliary troops, with the rank of Captain-General.
The contest which ensued is known as “<em>the
war of the Spanish succession</em>.”</p>

<p>Six regiments had been added to the regular army in
the year 1702 as <em>marine</em> corps, and six other of the
regular regiments of infantry (the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> being
among the number) were appointed for <em>sea service</em>; as
shown in the following list:&mdash;</p>

<p>The six regiments of marines were,&mdash;</p>

<p>Prior to the decease of King William the reduction
of Cadiz had been contemplated, after which it was
resolved to embark an expedition against the possessions
of Spain in the West Indies. Queen Anne following
out this policy, it was arranged that a combined fleet
of English and Dutch ships, consisting of fifty sail of the
line, besides frigates, under Admiral Sir George Rooke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and a land force, amounting to nearly fourteen thousand
men, under the command of the Duke of Ormond,
should proceed to the coast of Spain. The following
corps were selected for this service, namely,&mdash;</p>

<p>The difference in the number embarked, as shown in
the foregoing document, and that specified against the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> in the list of regiments ordered to proceed
to Cadiz, arises from the establishment being given
in the first instance, while the embarkation return has
reference only to effectives.</p>

<p>The armament appeared off Cadiz on the 12th of
August, and the Duke of Ormond summoned the
place; his terms being refused, a landing was effected
between Rota and Fort St. Catherine on the 15th of
that month, where the troops encountered and repulsed
some Spanish cavalry. St. Catherine’s fort was compelled
to surrender, and Port St. Mary’s was occupied
by the British troops; the expedition, however, proved
not of sufficient force to capture Cadiz, which was
found much stronger and better garrisoned than was
expected from the information which had been received
in England prior to the fitting out of the armament,
and the soldiers returned on board the fleet. The
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment was afterwards detached from
Cadiz to the West Indies with a division of the royal
navy under Commodore Walker, and sailed on this
service on the 24th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703.</div>

<p>A powerful armament was prepared for the attack of
the French and Spanish settlements in the West Indies
in 1703, but this enterprise was subsequently abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704.</div>

<p>After losing several men from the effects of the
climate, the regiment was withdrawn from the West
Indies, and was stationed in Ireland in the year 1704.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705.</div>

<p>The successes obtained by the Duke of Marlborough
in Flanders and Germany led to an attempt to place
the Archduke Charles of Austria on the throne of Spain
by force of arms. In the former year Gibraltar had
been captured by the combined English and Dutch
fleets, and in connexion with these events the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was embarked from Ireland in April<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
1705, in order to proceed with the force under the Earl
of Peterborough.</p>

<p>The design of this expedition was either to aid the
Duke of Savoy in driving the French out of Italy, to
make an attempt on Naples and Sicily, or to further
the progress of the Archduke in Spain. The fleet
arrived at Lisbon in June, and additional forces were
embarked; at the same time the Archduke Charles
went on board the fleet to share in the toils and dangers
inseparable from the enterprise. From Lisbon the
expedition proceeded to Gibraltar, where it was joined
by the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt and a reinforcement
from the garrison.</p>

<p>The fleet next proceeded to the bay of Altea, in
Valencia, and there the officers and soldiers had opportunities
of observing the attachment of the inhabitants
of that part of Spain to the Austrian Prince. A thousand
Catalonians and Valentians who had thrown off
their allegiance to the house of Bourbon, and had
acknowledged the Archduke Charles as the Sovereign
of Spain, seized on the town of Denia, while others
made demonstrations of giving effectual aid to the expedition;
such a spirit of enterprise was evinced by
King Charles, the Earl of Peterborough, the Prince of
Hesse Darmstadt, and others, that both officers and men
became imbued with the ardent zeal of their superiors,
and resolved to effect something great and remarkable.</p>

<p>Under these feelings, the celebrated city of <em>Barcelona</em>,
the capital of Catalonia, and one of the most ancient
towns in Spain, was selected as the scene of the
first attempt. Its situation on a plain near the sea, with
a mole capable of containing only galleys and small
ships, defended by ten bastions, several old towers, and
other works, with a strong castle and citadel named
<em>Montjuich</em>, on a hill on the west side, and commanding
the town; the garrison consisting of between five and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
six thousand men under the Viceroy of Catalonia, Don
Francisco de Velasco, while the besieging army was unable
to bring more than seven thousand men into the
lines; these circumstances, with the fact that in 1697
this fortress resisted the Duke of Vendôme, with a
French army of thirty thousand men, eight weeks with
open trenches, and cost the French monarch twelve
thousand men, gave an interesting and romantic character
to the enterprise, in which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-Sixth</span>,
and other regiments employed, gained much honour. It
is also to be noticed, that it was the same Prince of
Hesse Darmstadt who was now engaged in capturing
what he had before so nobly defended; for it was a question
whether the Duke of Vendôme gained more glory
by the taking, than the Prince of Darmstadt by defending
Barcelona, when employed in the Spanish service.</p>

<p>The Earl of Peterborough landed his troops on the
23d and 24th of August near the river Bassoz, about
three miles east of <em>Barcelona</em>. On the 28th of that
month, King Charles came on shore, and several of the
inhabitants of the neighbouring towns and villages
greeted his landing with great acclamations. The progress
of the siege was, however, retarded by opposite
opinions and views entertained by the superior officers.
It was at length determined to surprise the detached
fortress of <em>Montjuich</em>, as proposed by the Prince of Hesse
Darmstadt. The storming party of four hundred grenadiers,
selected from the various corps employed in the
siege, with a support of six hundred musketeers, commenced
its march in the night of Sunday the 13th of
September, round the mountains, and were followed by
another detachment and a party of dragoons. The
greater part of the way not being passable for above
one man abreast, and the night very dark, the first detachment
was nearly twelve hours on the march, and
did not arrive at the foot of the mountain until break
of day of the 14th of September; some Miquelets, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the service of the enemy, gave the alarm to the troops
in the castle and in the town, so that the Prince of
Hesse, on his arrival, found the garrison in arms, with
guards in the outworks, who received the Confederates
with a general discharge of artillery and small arms.
Upon this the Prince of Hesse, and the Viscount
Charlemont, Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment,
(who commanded on the 14th of September as Brigadier,
in consequence of the indisposition of the Dutch Brigadier
Schonenberg,) ordered Lieut.-Colonel Southwell,
of the Sixth foot, to commence the attack with the grenadiers;
this service was performed with signal intrepidity
and resolution. Upon this success the Prince of
Hesse Darmstadt advanced to possess himself of a post
which would prevent the enemy’s communication with
the town, and in the attempt was mortally wounded.
The loss of this officer damped the spirits of the soldiers;&mdash;the
enemy, perceiving some disorder amongst the
Confederates, called out, “Long live King Charles!”
and invited the assailants to come to them; upon Colonel
Allen’s advance to the fort, with about two hundred and
fifty men, the Spaniards opened the gate the better to
conceal their stratagem, but immediately fired upon the
men, and compelled this detachment to surrender; at
the same time, a large reinforcement was seen advancing
from the town to aid the garrison in the castle, whereupon
the troops were seized with a panic, and Lord
Charlemont, with other officers, endeavoured to counteract
the disorder which ensued.</p>

<p>Upon the Earl of Peterborough receiving this intelligence,
his lordship placed himself at the head of the
detachments that were retreating,&mdash;rallied them, and
ultimately regained the posts they had before so nobly
acquired; the Spaniards who were advancing from the
town retired, and the outworks of <em>Montjuich</em> were
gained. Batteries were then constructed, and the inner
works were assailed with cannon balls, bombs, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
grenades. After the action was over, the Earl of
Peterborough introduced Lord Charlemont and Lieut.-Colonel
Southwell to the King of Spain, as officers
that had done His Majesty signal service on this occasion;
for which they both received the thanks of that
Prince.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th of September, Lieut.-Colonel Southwell,
of the Sixth regiment of foot, being on duty in the
trenches, observed that the bombs thrown by a Dutch
bombardier from a small mortar fell to the left of the
fort, and concluding that there was a magazine in the
place, he traversed the mortar himself more to the right,
and fired it; the bomb fell into a small chapel where the
garrison had stored their powder, which exploded, and
buried a number of officers and men in the ruins.
Lieut.-Colonel Southwell advanced at the head of his
men, and was met by the surviving officers and men of
the garrison, who immediately surrendered the fortress.
The Lieut.-Colonel was made Governor of the place, in
consideration of his services.</p>

<p>The capture of <em>Montjuich</em> facilitated the siege of the
city of <em>Barcelona</em>, which was prosecuted with vigour;
and on the 4th of October the garrison agreed to capitulate.
The Viceroy made several extravagant demands,
which occupied some days in debating, so that the capitulation
was not signed until the evening of the 9th of
October; it was agreed that the Angel-gate and bastion
should be immediately delivered up to the Allies, and
the whole city four days after, when the garrison should
march out with all the honours of war. The capture of
Barcelona was accompanied by the submission to King
Charles of all Catalonia, with the exception of Roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>King Charles commenced forming a Spanish army
for his service; he soon had five hundred dragoons for
a guard, and six regiments of infantry. He was joined
by Colonel Nebot, who forsook the service of King
Philip with a regiment of horse, and in a short time
the province of Valencia submitted to the Austrian
Prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706.</div>

<p>The regiment continued under the immediate directions
of the Earl of Peterborough, with whose achievements
its services are connected; his raising the siege
of <em>San Matteo</em>, the capture of <em>Monviedro</em>, his exploits in
<em>Valencia</em>, and the relief of the capital of that province,&mdash;successes
gained with a small body of soldiers over a
numerous army,&mdash;carry with them the appearance of
fiction and romance more than of sober reality; but
being supported by abundance of collateral and direct
evidence, the truth of these achievements is unquestionable.
Unfortunately, no documents have been discovered
to prove what particular corps his lordship left
in garrison, and what he took with him in his daring
enterprise in Valencia; the part taken by the First and
Eighth dragoons, the Thirteenth, Thirtieth, and Thirty-fourth
foot, and a few other corps, can be clearly made
out from history; but whether the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
remained in garrison in Catalonia, or was employed in
the enterprise in Valencia, has not been ascertained.</p>

<p>King Charles and his counsellors, instead of exerting
themselves to provide for the security of the towns
which had been acquired, and collecting the means for
future conquests, wasted their time and money in balls
and public diversions. The breaches in Barcelona and
the detached fortress of Montjuich were left unrepaired,
and the garrison unprovided for a siege. Meanwhile
King Philip was obtaining reinforcements from the
frontiers of Portugal, from Italy, Provence, Flanders,
and the Rhine; and he soon appeared at the head of
above twenty thousand men to recapture the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
he had lost. A powerful French and Spanish force
approached <em>Barcelona</em> by land, a French fleet appeared
before the place, and the enemy encamped before the
north side of the city on the 2nd of April 1706.</p>

<p>The Earl of Peterborough hastened from Valencia
with a body of select troops, but found the town so
closely beset that he was unable to force his way into
it, when he took to the mountains, and harassed the
enemy with skirmishes and night alarms. When the
garrison was nearly exhausted, its numbers decreased
from deaths, wounds, sickness, and other causes to
about a thousand effective men, and a practicable breach
was ready for the enemy to attack the place by storm,
the English and Dutch fleet arrived with five regiments
of foot; the French fleet withdrew from before the
town, and the reinforcements were landed. Barcelona
being thus relieved, the enemy, having lost six thousand
men before the town, made a precipitate retreat on the
12th of May, leaving two hundred brass cannon, thirty
mortars, and vast quantities of ammunition and provision
behind him, together with the sick and wounded of his
army, whom Marshal de Tessé recommended to the
humanity of the British commander.</p>

<p>Barcelona was thus preserved by British skill and
valour; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, with the other regiments
in garrison, received the thanks of King Charles
for this important service.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May 1706, Lieut.-Colonel Thomas
Alnutt was promoted to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, in succession to the Viscount Charlemont,
who had been removed by the Earl of Peterborough.
A complaint on this subject was subsequently
preferred by Lord Charlemont; and the reports made
by the council of general officers, after a patient investigation,
are inserted in the memoir of that nobleman,
as Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, at <a href="#Page_109">page 109</a>.
These documents are highly flattering to Viscount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Charlemont, and bear ample testimony to his gallant
conduct at Barcelona.</p>

<p>An immediate advance upon Madrid having been
resolved upon, the Marquis das Minas and the Earl of
Galway, who commanded a British, Portuguese, and
Dutch force on the frontiers of Portugal, were requested
to penetrate boldly to the capital of Spain. To engage
in this service the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> embarked from Barcelona,
and proceeded by sea to Valencia, where King
Charles was expected to arrive with the cavalry by land.
While in Valencia the regiment furnished a detachment
of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, which, with
similar detachments from other <ins class="corr" id="tn-14" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'corps of infanty'">
corps of infantry</ins>, were
formed into a regiment of dragoons, named the Earl of
Peterborough’s regiment.</p>

<p><em>Requena</em> and <em>Cuenza</em>, which places lie on the line of
march from Valencia to Madrid, were captured after
a short resistance by the troops detached under Major-General
Wyndham. Meanwhile the army from Portugal
had penetrated to Madrid, and was anxiously awaiting
the arrival of King Charles, who, following the pernicious
advice of his Italian counsellors, delayed his
journey, and eventually proceeded by way of Arragon.
This afforded time for the French and Spanish troops
under King Philip to re-enter Spain; and uniting with
the forces under the Duke of Berwick, the enemy had
a great superiority of numbers. The allies were forced
to retire from their forward position, and being joined
on the 17th of September at Veles, by the troops
which had been detached under Major-General Wyndham,
they continued their route towards the frontiers
of Valencia and Murcia, where they remained during
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, in the year 1707, joined part of
the Allied army, which was composed of English,
Spaniards, Portuguese, and Dutch, commanded by the
Marquis das Minas and the Earl of Galway, and took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the field for offensive operations in the early part of
April. After destroying several of the enemy’s magazines,
the siege of the castle of <em>Villena</em> was undertaken,
and while this was in progress, a French and Spanish
force, of very superior numbers, commanded by the
Duke of Berwick, advanced to the plains of <em>Almanza</em>.
As the enemy expected the arrival of reinforcements
under the Duke of Orleans, the allied generals, though
much inferior in numbers, resolved to attack their
adversaries without delay.</p>

<p>The following regiments were present at the battle
of Almanza, and their effective strength is taken from
the weekly return dated 22nd of April, three days prior
to the battle:&mdash;</p>

<p>After a march of several hours along the rugged
tracts of Murcia under a burning sun, the soldiers
arrived in the presence of the enemy, at <em>Almanza</em>,
about noon on the 25th of April. It was nearly three
o’clock in the afternoon when the battle commenced.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> were formed in brigade with the
Ninth, Eleventh, and Lord Mark Kerr’s regiments under
Colonel Hill, and Mino’s Portuguese dragoons were
posted in the centre of the brigade, which was stationed
in the second line; but nine of the enemy’s battalions
having attacked Major-General Wade’s brigade, consisting
of the Sixth, Seventeenth, Thirty-third, and Lord
Montjoy’s regiments, the Ninth moved forward to their
support. Great valour was displayed, but in vain, for
the flight of the Portuguese squadrons had left the
British and Dutch exposed to the weight and power of
the enemy’s superior numbers, and no hope of victory
remained. The Earl of Galway effected his retreat
with the dragoons; several general officers collected the
broken remains of the English infantry, which fought
in the centre, into a body, and uniting them with some
Dutch and Portuguese, formed a column of nearly four
thousand men, which retreated two leagues, repulsing
the pursuing enemy from time to time. On arriving at
the woody hills of Caudete, the men were so exhausted
with fatigue that they were unable to proceed further:
they passed the night in the wood without food, and on
the following morning they were surrounded by the
enemy. Being without ammunition, ignorant of the
country, and having no prospect of obtaining food, they
surrendered prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Thus ended a battle in which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment behaved with great gallantry, but was nearly
annihilated. Captains Musgrave and Parsons, Lieutenants
Ayriss and Ballance, and Ensign Wells were
killed; the following officers of the regiment were taken
prisoners:&mdash;</p>

<p>The number of non-commissioned officers and soldiers
killed, wounded, and taken prisoners at the battle of
Almanza has not been ascertained; those who escaped,
and were found serviceable, were afterwards transferred
to other corps in Spain, and certain of the officers
returned to England to recruit the regiment.</p>

<p>On the 15th of September 1707, orders were addressed
to Colonel Alnutt to recruit and fill up the
respective companies of the regiment; and the recruits
were to assemble at Chester and Namptwich, which
places were appointed for the rendezvous of the corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708.</div>

<p>In the Annals of Queen Anne for the year 1708, it is

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1709.</div>

<p>Colonel Archibald Earl of Ilay, afterwards Duke of
Argyle, was appointed to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment on the 23d of March 1709, in succession
to Colonel Thomas Alnutt, deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710.</div>

<p>On the 23d of October 1710, Colonel Henry Desaulnais
(afterwards spelt Desney) from the Coldstream
foot guards, was appointed to the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, in succession to Colonel the
Earl of Ilay, resigned.</p>

<p>During the nine years which this war had been raging
in Europe, British blood and treasure had been expended
in making conquests for the house of Austria. The
only advantage which had accrued to Great Britain was,
that the power of the House of Bourbon had been
diminished, and that of Austria augmented; the new
Ministry chosen by Queen Anne, in 1710, resolved to
act upon a different principle. Colonel Nicholson
having made a successful attack on Port Royal, in
Nova Scotia, on his return to England he submitted
to the Government a plan for the reduction of Placentia
and Quebec, as a preparatory measure for
acquiring Canada for the British crown, and for expelling
the French from Newfoundland, in order to
regain the fishery.</p>

<p>Canada is stated to have been discovered by the
famous Italian adventurer, Sebastian Cabot, who sailed
under a commission from Henry VII.; and as the
English monarch did not make any use of the discovery,
the French soon attempted to derive advantage from it.
Several small settlements were established, and in the
early part of the seventeenth century the city of <em>Quebec</em>
was founded for the capital of the French possessions in
this part of the world. Although the colony continued
in a very depressed state for some time, and the settlers
were frequently in danger of being exterminated by
the Indians, yet, in the beginning of the eighteenth
century, it had become of such importance that its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
capture was considered one of the best means of
weakening the power of Louis XIV.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711.</div>

<p>An expedition, consisting of about five thousand
men, was accordingly ordered to proceed to North
America under Brigadier-General Hill, for the purpose
of making an attempt on Quebec. A large fleet
formed part of the armament under Commodore Sir
Hovenden Walker, and the force was to be further
strengthened by troops from the North American
colonies. The following regiments were employed on
the expedition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pad4 fs80">
Kirke’s regiment, now Second foot.<br />
The Queen’s, now Fourth foot.<br />
Hill’s, now Eleventh foot.<br />
Desney’s, now <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> foot.<br />
Windress’s, now Thirty-seventh foot.<br />
Clayton’s, disbanded in 1712.<br />
Kane’s, disbanded in 1713.<br />
Churchill’s Marines, disbanded in 1713.<br />
Walton’s and Vetch’s, North American Militia, joined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the expedition at Boston.<br />
</div>

<p>On arriving at North America the fleet called at
Boston for a supply of provisions, and the troops landed
and encamped a short time on Rhode Island; but on
the 20th of July they re-embarked, and having been
joined by two regiments of provincial troops commanded
by Colonels Walton and Vetch, sailed on the
30th of July from Boston for the river St. Lawrence.
The expedition did not reach the river St. Lawrence
until the 21st of August, when it encountered storms,
and being furnished with bad pilots, eight transports,
a store-ship, and a sloop were lost by shipwreck, and
twenty-nine officers, six hundred and seventy-six soldiers,
and thirty-five women of the Fourth, Thirty-seventh,
Colonel Kane’s, and Colonel Clayton’s regiments, perished.
There was also a scarcity of provisions. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
was, therefore, determined in a council of war, that
further operations should be abandoned. Some of the
regiments engaged in the expedition proceeded to
Annapolis Royal, in Nova Scotia, but the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
returned to England, and arrived at Portsmouth
on the 9th of October.</p>

<p>On the 12th of October 1711, Charles III., the
claimant to the throne of Spain, was elected Emperor
of Germany by the title of Charles VI., his brother
Joseph having died at Vienna in the preceding April.
This circumstance materially affected the war, and
inclined Great Britain to agree to peace; for the consolidation
of Spain with the Empire of Germany would
have perilled the balance of power in Europe as much
as the anticipated union of the crowns of France and
Spain. The course of events had also shown, that a
French and not an Austrian Prince was the choice of
the Spanish nation.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. finding his armies defeated and dispirited,
by the victorious troops under the celebrated
Duke of Marlborough, at length sued for peace, negociations
for which were shortly afterwards commenced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712.</div>

<p>The conditions of a Treaty of Peace having been
agreed upon between Queen Anne and the French
monarch, Dunkirk was delivered up to the British by
Louis XIV., as a security for the performance of the
stipulations, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> formed part of the
force embarked under Brigadier-General Hill, to occupy
that fortress. The regiment sailed from the Downs
on the 7th of July 1712, with the fleet under Admiral
Sir John Leake; on the following day the troops
landed at Dunkirk, relieving the French guards at
the citadel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713.</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed at Dunkirk the
Treaty of Utrecht was signed on the 11th of April
1713, which terminated the “War of the Spanish
Succession.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1714.</div>

<p>In the spring of 1714, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
returned to England; on the 1st of August of that
year Queen Anne died, and was succeeded by King
George I. The new sovereign having been quietly
seated on the throne, the regiment proceeded to Ireland,
and was placed on the establishment of that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715.</div>

<p>On the 11th of July 1715, Colonel William Egerton
was appointed by His Majesty King George I. to be
Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, in succession
to Colonel H. Desney, upon whom was subsequently
conferred the colonelcy of the Twenty-ninth regiment.</p>

<p>While the regiment was in Ireland, an insurrection
was organized in England, by the partizans of the
house of Stuart; at the same time the Earl of Mar
summoned the Highland clans to arms, and proclaimed
the Pretender King of Great Britain. On the breaking
out of the rebellion, the regiment was withdrawn
from Ireland, in the autumn of 1715; and it joined
the troops encamped near Stirling under the Duke
of Argyle.</p>

<p>In the early part of November, the rebel army advanced
towards the Forth, with the view of penetrating
to England, and the Duke of Argyle marched from
Stirling to <em>Dumblaine</em>, near <em>Sheriffmuir</em>, for the purpose
of opposing the progress of the insurgents. On
the morning of Sunday, the 13th of November, the
enemy, ten thousand strong, was seen advancing in
order of battle; and the King’s troops, not mustering
four thousand men, moved forward to engage their
opponents. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment was in the
left wing of the royal army. At a critical moment it
was ordered to make a change of position, and, while
in the act of re-forming, it was attacked by an immense
body of Highlanders, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of the insurgent host.
The soldiers were unable to withstand the very superior
numbers of their opponents, and the left wing became
separated from the main body of the army, and retired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
beyond <em>Dumblaine</em>, to gain possession of the passes
leading to Stirling. In the meantime, the right wing
of the royal army had overpowered the left wing of the
rebels, and chased it from the field. Thus both generals
had one wing victorious, and one wing defeated: both
in consequence claimed the victory. The insurgents
were, however, prevented penetrating southward, and
were defeated in their object. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
had one serjeant and twenty-one rank and file killed;
Captain Danoer, and fourteen rank and file, were
wounded. From the field of battle the troops proceeded
to Stirling, where they again encamped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716.</div>

<p>Towards the end of December the Pretender arrived
in Scotland, and assumed all the ensigns of royalty.
He held his court at Scone, and his head-quarters were
at Perth: but the Highland chieftains finding it impossible
to resist the royal forces, resolved to abandon
the enterprize. They, however, burnt several villages,
to distress the Duke of Argyle in his march, who, in
January 1716, obliged them to abandon Perth, whence
they retired to Montrose, where the Pretender escaped
on board a French ship, together with the Earl of Mar
and other adherents. After this the rebels dispersed
to the Highlands.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment was subsequently
stationed at Dumbarton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1718.</div>

<p>In the year 1718 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
proceeded to Ireland. In July 1718, the King of
Spain having taken Sardinia and invaded Sicily, the
“<em>Quadruple Alliance</em>” was formed between Great
Britain, France, Germany, and Holland. War was
declared against Spain in December by England and
France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1719.</div>

<p>The King of Spain afterwards made preparations in
favour of the Pretender, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
embarked, in March 1719, at Cork for Great
Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Brigadier-General Sir Charles Hotham, Bart., was
appointed Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on
the 7th of July 1719, in succession to Colonel Egerton,
removed to the Twentieth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1720.</div>

<p>In January 1720 the King of Spain accepted the
conditions of peace, and acceded to the “<em>Quadruple
Alliance</em>,” which had been formed two years previously
between Great Britain, France, Germany, and Holland;
in consequence of which the regiment returned to
Ireland, where it remained for several years.</p>

<p>On the 2d of December 1720 Colonel John Pocock
was appointed to the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, in succession to Brigadier-General Sir Charles
Hotham, Bart., removed to the Eighth, or the King’s
regiment of foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1721.</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Charles Lenoe was promoted from
the Coldstream guards to be colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, on the 21st of April 1721, in succession
to Colonel John Pocock, removed to the
Eighth, or the King’s regiment of foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1732.</div>

<p>On the 14th of May 1732, Brigadier-General John
Moyle was appointed Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, upon the removal to the Eighth, or the King’s
regiment of foot, of Colonel Charles Lenoe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1737.</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Humphrey Bland, from the Second
horse, now the First dragoon guards, was promoted to
the rank of Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on
the 27th of June 1737, in succession to Major-General
John Moyle, removed to the Twenty-second regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739.</div>

<p>The claim of the Spanish Government to the right of
search, and the aggressions committed by that power
on the commerce of Great Britain, in the West Indies,
by the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">guarda-costas</i> and other ships acting by authority
of the King of Spain, contrary to the existing
treaties, led to a Convention between the two Crowns,
which was concluded on the 14th of January 1739.
This Convention stipulated, that compensation should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
be made by Spain to the English Government, in
reparation for the hostilities committed on the British
subjects in the American seas. The Court of Madrid,
however, violated the Convention, and hostilities being
on the eve of commencing, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
was removed from Ireland to Great Britain in September
1739. On the 23d of October following, war
was proclaimed by Great Britain against Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740.</div>

<p>A formidable armament was prepared for the attack
of the Spanish colonies in the West Indies, and the
land forces were placed under the command of General
Lord Cathcart. On the 12th of June 1740 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was ordered to proceed to Portsmouth
for embarkation, but only a portion of the corps subsequently
proceeded on this service. Some delay occurred
by the fleet being twice driven back by contrary winds.
On the 26th of October it sailed a third time, and was
dispersed by a tempest in the Bay of Biscay; but the
greater part of the vessels were re-collected, and proceeded
on the voyage. Arriving at the neutral island
of Dominica, to provide wood and water, the troops
sustained the loss of their commander, Lord Cathcart,
(then Colonel of the Sixth dragoon guards,
or Carabineers,) who died of dysentery; the command,
in consequence, devolved on Brigadier-General
Thomas Wentworth, Colonel of the Twenty-fourth
regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741.</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel James Fleming was promoted from
the Seventh Royal fusiliers to the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on the 9th of January 1741,
in succession to Colonel Humphrey Bland, removed to
the Thirteenth dragoons.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Jamaica, in January 1741, the
expedition was joined by Vice-Admiral Vernon; but
the season of the year for active service in the West
Indies was fast passing away, and several circumstances
concurred to create further delay. At length an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
attempt on <em>Carthagena</em>, the capital of a wealthy province
in the country of Terra Firma, in South America,
was resolved upon. This place was found strongly
fortified, and the garrison was reinforced by the crews
of a squadron of large ships. A landing was effected
on the island of Terra Bomba, near the mouth of the
harbour, on the 10th of March, and the siege of the
principal fort or castle, named <em>Bocca-chica</em>, was commenced.
On the evening of the 25th of March the
grenadiers mounted the breach to storm the fortress,
when the Spanish garrison fled, and the place was
captured without loss.</p>

<p>Two channels having been made through the sunk
vessels with which the Spaniards had blocked up
the entrance of the harbour, the troops and artillery
were re-embarked, and commenced landing on the
5th of April near the city. The country round Carthagena
was found covered with trees and herbage
of the most luxuriant growth, and the interwoven
branches formed a shelter impenetrable both to heat
and light; as the troops, led by Brigadier-General
Blakeney, advanced along a narrow defile, several
men were wounded by shots from the openings into
the wood; on diverging from the defile six hundred
Spaniards were seen advantageously posted to
dispute the passage; but they were speedily driven
from their ground, and the British bivouacked within
a mile of the castle of <em>Lazar</em>, which commanded
the town. The men passed three nights in the open
air for want of tents and tools, which could not be
landed sooner, and the health of the soldiers was in
consequence seriously injured. The siege of the castle
was commenced, but as the men were fast diminishing
in numbers from hard duty and the effects of climate,
Brigadier-General Wentworth resolved to attack <em>St.
Lazar</em> by escalade. The attempt was made on the
9th of April before day-break, but without success,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
although the assailants evinced distinguished gallantry.
After sustaining a most destructive fire for several
hours with intrepidity and perseverance, the troops
were ordered to retire, having sustained a severe loss
in killed and wounded.</p>

<p>Violent periodical rains commenced, the country was
deluged with water, and the change of atmosphere produced
fatal effects on the health of the men, who were
drenched with rain. All hope of further success immediately
vanished, and the troops returned on board
the fleet, where numbers died from the distempers
incidental to the climate.</p>

<p>The forts of the harbour of Carthagena having been
demolished, the fleet sailed for Jamaica, and the portion
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment which had formed part
of the expedition subsequently returned to Great
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1743.</div>

<p>During the year 1743 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
was stationed in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744.</div>

<p>In the year 1744 France and Great Britain, from
being auxiliaries in the “<em>War of the Austrian Succession</em>,”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
became principals in the contest. On the 20th
of March 1744 France declared war against England,
and on the 29th of that month a counter-declaration
was made by Great Britain, in which the French
Monarch was accused of violating the “<em>Pragmatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Sanction</em>,”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and of assisting the son of the Pretender
in his designs on the British throne.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1744 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and other
regiments were embarked to join the troops in Flanders;
but the operations of the British army during that year
were confined to the defensive, and no general engagement
occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745.</div>

<p>In the spring of 1745 a French army, commanded by
Marshal Saxe, invested Tournay, and the Duke of
Cumberland, who had assumed the command of the
allied army of British, Dutch, and Austrians, advanced
to the relief of the town. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
was left <ins class="corr" id="tn-27" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'in garison at'">
in garrison at</ins> Ghent, and was consequently not
at the battle of Fontenoy, which was fought on the
11th of May. The Duke of Cumberland having failed
in the attempt to relieve Tournay, retreated and encamped
his army at Lessines. In the meantime events
were transpiring in Scotland which occasioned the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and other regiments to be embarked for
England.</p>

<p>Charles Edward, eldest son of the Pretender, having
arrived at a remote part of Scotland, was joined by many
of the Highland clans, when he proceeded to assert his
father’s pretentions to the throne. The young adventurer
and his hardy mountaineers made considerable
progress, and advanced as far as Derby, but subsequently
retreated towards Scotland. Upon the arrival of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment in England, it formed part of
the army assembled at Newcastle under Field-Marshal
Wade, and upon the young Pretender’s advance into
England, was employed in several movements designed
to cover Yorkshire. On the retreat of the insurgent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
clans from England, the regiment returned to
Newcastle, and was afterwards ordered to proceed to
Edinburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746.</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Edinburgh in January 1746,
and was placed under the orders of Lieut.-General
Hawley, the commander of the forces in North Britain.
Meanwhile the young Pretender being joined by new
levies, and having procured artillery and ammunition,
obtained possession of the town of Stirling and commenced
the siege of the castle. In order to raise the
siege Lieut.-General Hawley advanced from Edinburgh,
and an encampment was formed near the village of
<em>Falkirk</em>. On the 17th of January, as the King’s troops
were at dinner in the camp, the advance of the enemy
was discovered; the royal forces seized their arms and
proceeded along some rugged and difficult grounds to a
large moor, where the rebel army appeared in order of
battle.</p>

<p>Success or failure in the hour of battle has sometimes
been found to depend upon accidental circumstances
over which the commanders of armies have
no control. Such was the case at the battle of
<em>Falkirk</em>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> at which a tempest of wind and rain beat
so violently in the faces of the royal forces at the
moment when they engaged their adversaries, that
their ammunition was spoiled in the act of loading;
the soldiers could not see their opponents, and
several regiments gave way, while others maintained
their ground. At night both parties withdrew from
the field of battle, and the King’s troops proceeded
to Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland arrived
in Scotland to command the army, and on the 31st of
January the troops were again in motion towards the
enemy, who instantly raised the siege of Stirling
Castle, and made a precipitate retreat to Inverness.
The royal forces followed in pursuit, but were delayed
in their advance by severe weather. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was engaged in the operations of the
army until the battle of <em>Culloden</em> on the 16th of April,
on which occasion it composed part of the second line
under Major-General Huske. The following return
shows the number of officers and men in each regiment
of infantry on the morning of the battle:&mdash;</p>

<p>After a sharp cannonade several select clans of
mountaineers sprang forward, and with shouts and
dismal yells attacked the King’s forces sword in hand.
In less than an hour after the commencement of the
action the enemy’s forces were overthrown and a decisive
victory was obtained, which effectually suppressed the
rebellion.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment sustained but small
loss, having only six men wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p>After halting a short time at Inverness the army
advanced into the highlands, and encamped in the gloomy
valley, surrounded by rugged precipices, near Fort
Augustus, from whence detachments were sent out to
search for arms, and for persons who had been engaged
in the rebellion. Prince Charles, after enduring many
hardships, succeeded in escaping to France in September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747.</div>

<p>Meanwhile hostilities had been continued on the
Continent, and in the beginning of 1747, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment re-embarked at Gravesend for Flanders.
After having joined the army commanded by His Royal
Highness the Duke of Cumberland, the regiment was
engaged in several operations near the frontiers of
Holland, which led to the battle of <em>Laffeld</em>, or <em>Val</em>,
fought on the 2d of July 1747, in the villages in the
vicinity of Maestricht. On this occasion the allied
army was very inferior in numbers to the enemy,
and although the British infantry were conspicuous
throughout the action for the gallantry with which
they fought, the Duke of Cumberland was obliged
to order a retreat. His Royal Highness passed the
highest encomiums on the British troops for their
conduct in this battle; and according to the “London
Gazette,” there was not a squadron or battalion
which did not charge and beat the enemy more than
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment in this battle
was Major Petrie, Lieutenant Brodie, two serjeants,
and twenty-two rank and file, killed; with Lieut.-Colonel
Jackson, Captains Morgan, Pechell, Dod, and
Gore, Lieutenant Ackland, Ensigns Vaughan, Duncan,
Elrington, Strong, and Porter, three serjeants, two
drummers, and seventy-four rank and file, wounded;
and eighty-two men missing.</p>

<p>After withdrawing from the field of battle, the army
continued its retreat to Maestricht, where it arrived on
the same evening. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment was
subsequently employed in various parts of the provinces
of Limburg and North Brabant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748.</div>

<p>The regiment again took the field in the spring of
1748, and was employed in several operations, but no
general engagement occurred. Hostilities were at
length terminated by a treaty of peace, which was
signed at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 7th of October 1748.
During the winter the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> returned to
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749.</div>

<p>On its arrival from Holland, the establishment of
the regiment was reduced, and it was ordered to proceed
to Gibraltar, in which fortress it was stationed
during the five following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751.</div>

<p>Colonel Lord Robert Manners was appointed by
His Majesty King George II. to the colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on the 13th of March 1751,
in succession to Major-General James Fleming,
deceased.</p>

<p>In the Royal Warrant, dated the 1st of July 1751,
for ensuring uniformity in the clothing, standards,
and colours of the army, and regulating the numerical
title and rank of regiments, the facings of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
were directed to be <em>green</em>. The first, or King’s
colour, was the great union; the second, or regimental
colour, was of green silk, with the union in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the upper canton; in the centre of the colour the
number of the rank of the regiment, in gold Roman
characters, within a wreath of roses and thistles on the
same stalk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1754.</div>

<p>In 1754 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment returned to
England from Gibraltar, and was subsequently stationed
in North Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755.</div>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1755 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was removed from Scotland to South
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756.</div>

<p>The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was at length interrupted
by the aggressions of the French on the British
territory in North America; and early in 1756 the
King of France prepared a powerful armament for the
capture of the island of Minorca. In consequence of
this attack on Minorca, hostilities became inevitable on
the part of Great Britain, and on the 18th of May
war was declared against France. At this period
the army and navy were increased; and, among
other augmentations, fifteen of the regiments of
infantry, including the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, were authorized
to raise second battalions from the 25th of
August 1756.</p>

<p>From the 17th of June to the 12th of October 1756,
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and other regiments were encamped
at Chatham under Major-General Lord George
Sackville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757.</div>

<p>In the year 1757 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, consisting
of two battalions, and other corps were encamped
under General Charles Duke of Marlborough at
Barham Downs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758.</div>

<p>The second battalions, which had been added
two years previously to fifteen of the regiments of
infantry, were, in 1758, formed into distinct corps,
and numbered from the Sixty-first to the Seventy-fifth
regiment. By this arrangement the second battalion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> was constituted the Seventy-fourth
regiment, which was disbanded after the peace
of Fontainebleau.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Government resolved upon making a descent
on the French coast, by which it was expected to
create such a diversion in favour of the British allies
in Germany as would obviate the necessity of sending
them a reinforcement of troops. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
formed a part of the army selected for this service, which
amounted to fourteen thousand men, and was commanded
by General Charles Duke of Marlborough.
The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> proceeded to the Isle of Wight,
where it was formed in brigade with the Fifth, Twenty-fifth,
and Seventy-fourth regiments (the latter corps
since disbanded), under Major-General John Mostyn.
The embarkation commenced on the 24th of May;
the expedition sailed on the 1st of June, and on the
5th of that month a landing was effected, without loss,
about two leagues to the eastward of <em>St. Maloes</em>,
towards which place the army advanced in two columns
on the 7th of June, and encamped within a mile from
the town: here the Commander-in-Chief reconnoitred,
and having observed several houses filled with naval
and military stores, which were not protected by the
guns of the town, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, in common with
the other regiments, furnished a detachment, which was
sent after dark to set fire to them, a service which was most
effectually performed, thirteen vessels of war, besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
several merchantmen, and vast quantities of stores being
destroyed. <em>St. Maloes</em>, though incapable of making an
effectual resistance against a regular siege, was considered
too strong to be attempted by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>; the troops
were accordingly re-embarked, and preparations were
afterwards made for a descent at Granville, on the coast
of Normandy, and afterwards at Cherbourg; but, the
weather being severe, the fleet returned to England.</p>

<p>In August of the same year the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> was
engaged in a second expedition to the coast of France,
when <em>Cherbourg</em> was captured, and the harbour, forts,
magazines, and ordnance, consisting of 173 pieces of
iron cannon and three mortars were destroyed; at the
same time, 22 pieces of fine brass cannon and two brass
mortars were brought off as trophies, and sent to
England, when, after being viewed by King George II.
in Hyde Park, they were conducted in procession through
the City to the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Another descent was made on the coast of Brittany
on the 4th of September, when the batteries in the bay
of St. Lunaire were destroyed, and the troops marched
into the interior, while the fleet proceeded to the bay
of St. Cass, thus alarming the country with the view of
producing the return of the French army from Germany.
Upon the troops being re-embarked at St. Cass, the
enemy attacked the rear-guard and occasioned considerable
loss. Towards the end of September the regiment
landed at Cowes, and, having encamped a short period
near Newport, went into winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.</div>

<p>During the summer of 1759 the regiment was
encamped at Chatham under Lieut.-General John
Campbell, afterwards Duke of Argyle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760.</div>

<p>In the course of the year 1760 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was encamped at Sandheath under Lieut.-General
the Earl of Ancram.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761.</div>

<p>In the spring of 1761 a force proceeded under the
command of Major-General Studholme Hodgson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
against <em>Belle-Isle</em>, a French island in the Bay of
Biscay, off the coast of Brittany. The expedition
appeared before <em>Belle-Isle</em> on the 7th of April, and a
landing was attempted on the following day, but
without success;&mdash;other endeavours to secure a landing
on different points of the island proving also unsuccessful,
orders were given to desist from the attempt, and
the men returned to the boats, and proceeded back to
their several ships. Many of the boats were destroyed
or damaged in these efforts, and about five hundred
men were lost in killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>Major-General Hodgson subsequently received the
following reinforcements, of which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
formed part:&mdash;</p>

<p>A landing was effected by Brigadier-General Hamilton
Lambert on the 22d of April, on the rocks near
Point Lomaria, where the difficulty of ascending the
precipice had made the enemy least attentive to that
part. Beauclerk’s grenadiers (Nineteenth foot), with
Captain Patterson, of that regiment, gained the summit
before the enemy saw what was intended, who immediately
marched a body of three hundred men to attack
them; the grenadiers, however, maintained their ground
till the remainder of Brigadier Lambert’s troops arrived.
The success thus gained was promptly followed up; the
French were eventually repulsed, and three brass field-pieces,
with a few prisoners, were captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>The cannon was afterwards landed from the ships and
dragged up the rocks; the lines which covered the town
of Palais were carried by assault, and the siege of the
citadel was prosecuted with vigour. The garrison,
under their governor, the Chevalier de St. Croix, made
a gallant defence; but on the 7th of June were forced
to surrender, and were permitted to march through the
breach with the honours of war, in consideration of their
bravery. The capture of the island was thus achieved,
with the loss of about eighteen hundred men killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>This conquest was regarded with great pride by the
British nation; but the island was restored to France,
at the peace of Fontainebleau in 1763, in exchange for
Minorca, which had been taken by the French at the
commencement of the war.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the year 1761 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was stationed in South Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment during 1762 continued
to be quartered in South Britain. In January war
was declared against Spain, and in the summer of that
year the regiment was encamped at Sandheath under
Lieut.-General Edward Carr. Negociations for peace
were shortly afterwards commenced, and the preliminary
articles were signed at Fontainebleau by the Duke
of Bedford on the 3d of November 1762.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763.</div>

<p>On the 10th of February 1763 the treaty of
Fontainebleau was concluded at Paris, the ratifications
were exchanged on the 10th of March, and
peace was proclaimed in London on the 22d of that
month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment embarked on the 17th
of March 1764 for Jamaica, in which island it was stationed
for some years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765.</div>

<p>Major-General Richard Pierson was removed from
the Sixty-third to the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on the
11th of September 1765, in succession to Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Lord Robert Manners, appointed to the Third
dragoon guards.</p>

<p>In 1773 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> returned home from
Jamaica, and the regiment arrived in England in June
of that year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774.</div>

<p>On the 6th of August 1774, the light infantry companies
of the Third, Eleventh, Twenty-first, Twenty-ninth,
Thirty-second, <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, and Seventieth
regiments assembled at Salisbury, where they were
formed into a brigade, and disciplined under the command
of Major-General the Honourable Sir William
Howe until the 4th of October following, when they
were reviewed by His Majesty King George III. in
Richmond Park, and were afterwards ordered to rejoin
their respective regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775.</div>

<p>The war with the American colonies commenced in
April 1775, but the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment did not
proceed to that country; on the 10th of September following
it embarked at Portsmouth for Ireland, where
it was stationed for the seven following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778.</div>

<p>Colonel the Honourable Henry St. John, Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Sixty-seventh regiment, was appointed
Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> on the 27th of November
1778, in succession to Lieut.-General Richard Pierson,
removed to the Thirteenth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782.</div>

<p>A letter, dated the 31st of August 1782, conveyed to
the regiment His Majesty’s pleasure that county titles
should be conferred on the infantry, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
was directed to assume the designation of the
<span class="smcap">Herefordshire</span> regiment, in order that a connexion
between the corps and that county should be cultivated,
which might be useful in promoting the success of the
recruiting service.</p>

<p>On the 6th of September 1782, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was brought from Ireland, and placed on the
British establishment, and occupied Hilsea barracks,
near Portsmouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The contest with the American colonists had involved
Great Britain in war with France, Spain, and
Holland; but on the 30th of November 1782, the preliminary
articles of peace were signed at Paris between
Great Britain and the United States of America, and
the treaty was concluded in the ensuing February.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783.</div>

<p>In the year 1783, peace was concluded between
England, France, Spain, and Holland. A new field
of service was about to open for the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
that regiment having been selected to proceed to the
East Indies, for which country it embarked at Portsmouth
on the 10th of March 1783, and arrived at
Madras in July following, while the British were
engaged in hostilities against the powerful Sultan
of the Mysore, Tippoo Saib, who, on the death of his
father, Hyder Ali, in December of the preceding
year, had succeeded to the dominions of that soldier
of fortune.</p>

<p>The regiment, being thirteen hundred strong, was
immediately transferred from the Indiamen into King’s
ships, and proceeded, under the command of Brevet-Colonel
Allan Campbell, to the relief of <em>Mangalore</em>, on
the Malabar coast, which had been invested by Tippoo
Saib on the 18th of May 1783, and was gallantly defended
by the second battalion of the Forty-second
regiment (afterwards numbered the Seventy-third regiment)
and some native corps. Meanwhile the general
peace, which had been entered into with <ins class="corr" id="tn-38" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the Europeau Powers'">
the European Powers</ins>, deprived Tippoo of his French allies, and the
Sultan entered into negotiations for terminating the
war between Mysore and the British. The troops
under Brigadier-General Macleod appeared in sight of
Mangalore on the 24th of November 1783, but on the
1st of December, in consequence of the following circumstances,
the ships sailed to the southward.</p>

<p>Some boats with Sepoys having at this period been
wrecked near <em>Cannanore</em>, upon the Malabar coast, about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
two hundred of them were seized and detained by Ali
Rajah Biby, the Queen of that country; repeated applications
were made for their release, but without success,
and Brigadier-General Norman Macleod determined to
take satisfaction for these injuries, immediately after
the relief of Mangalore. Tippoo Saib desired him to
desist, and claimed the ruler of the Cannanore country
as his ally.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment proceeded under the
command of Major the Honourable John Knox to <em>Cannanore</em>,
which was captured by the troops under Brigadier-General
Macleod in December 1783.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1784.</div>

<p>On the 11th of March 1784 peace was concluded
with Tippoo Saib, the Sultan of Mysore; one of the
articles of the treaty stipulated, that the fort and district
of <em>Cannanore</em> should be evacuated and restored to
Ali Rajah Biby, the Queen of that country.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1785 &nbsp;to 1788.</div>

<p>During the years 1785, 1786, 1787, and 1788, the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment occupied cantonments at Poonamallee,
Arcot, Vellore, and Wallahabad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789.</div>

<p>The insatiable ambition of Tippoo Saib, the Sultan
of the Mysore territory, soon involved the British
Government of India in another war; he appeared near
the confines of the country of Travancore, at the head
of a powerful army, made unreasonable demands on the
Rajah, a British ally, and commenced hostilities towards
the end of December 1789.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790.</div>

<p>A force was consequently directed to be assembled, in
March 1790, at Wallahabad, under the orders of Colonel
Thomas Musgrave of the Seventy-sixth regiment; it
was put in movement on the 29th of that month, and
proceeded towards Trichinopoly, at which place the
troops arrived on the 29th of April, where the following
corps had been collected under the command of Colonel
Bridges:&mdash;Two King’s regiments, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
and Seventy-second; the Second and Fifth Native
cavalry; the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Sixteenth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Twentieth, and Twenty-third Coast sepoys. At the
same time Colonel Deare, with three companies of Bengal
artillery, joined, the whole being under the orders
of Major-General Musgrave, to which rank he had been
promoted on the 28th of April 1790.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May Major-General (afterwards Sir
William) Medows assumed the command, and reviewed
the army, which was directed to proceed towards the
Coimbatore country.</p>

<p>Advancing from Trichinopoly on the 26th of May,
and penetrating the enemy’s country, the army arrived,
after a march of about fifty miles, on the 15th of June,
at the fort of Caroor, where the troops encamped
eighteen days, while provisions were being collected and
a magazine formed. Leaving this place on the 3d of
July, the army marched to Daraporam, which was
abandoned by the enemy; a garrison was left at this
place, and the army marched through a beautiful country
to the city of Coimbatore, where the British arrived on
the 22nd July; here the army halted, and detachments
were sent off to reduce Dindigul, Errode, and Palghautcherry.
About the end of July, Colonel, afterwards
General Sir John Floyd, of the Nineteenth light
dragoons (since disbanded), with the Cavalry of the
army and a brigade of Native infantry, was ordered to
take possession of the small and weak fort of <em>Sattimungulum</em>,
in which, after its capture, he placed a battalion
of sepoys. At this period the army was separated in
three divisions, one at Coimbatore, one at Sattimungulum,
sixty miles in advance, and one besieging Palghautcherry.
Tippoo resolved to attack, and if possible
destroy, the division in advance before the main body
could arrive to its support. The troops from Coimbatore
were accordingly ordered to march, to reinforce
Colonel Floyd.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" id="tn-40" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'In the begining'">
In the beginning</ins> of September a detachment of troops
under Colonel Oldham, of which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></span>
formed part, marched from Errode to join Colonel Floyd
at <em>Sattimungulum</em>, which place was reached in three days.
Colonel Floyd’s entire force now consisted of His Majesty’s
Nineteenth light dragoons and sixteen troops of
Native cavalry, His Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
and five battalions of Native infantry, eleven guns, and
a due proportion of artillerymen and officers. Detachments
of cavalry were sent almost every day to scour
the country towards the Gudzelhetty Pass, and they
generally brought in a few of the enemy’s horse, belonging
to Syde Saib’s party, stationed at the foot of the
Ghauts, who were much distressed for provisions and
forage, his people having been constantly obliged to
cross the Boovany, in order to procure grain in the
different villages, in which places they were generally
taken prisoners; their horses were very small and bad.
A deposit of grain and provisions was in the meantime
formed in this frontier station for the use of the army
under Major-General Medows, which was destined to
ascend to Mysore by the Gudzelhetty Pass early in October.
On the 11th and 12th of September it was reported
in camp that Tippoo, in person, had descended the Gudzelhetty
Pass with a large army of cavalry and infantry,
with several pieces of artillery. On the morning of the
12th of September Tippoo’s army, estimated at about
thirty thousand cavalry, infantry, and artillery, descended
the Gudzelhetty Pass, and crossed the Boovany
river at daybreak of the following morning. A reconnoitring
party of British cavalry, under Major Child,
encountered the enemy’s advance guard of cavalry on
the 13th, and compelled it to recross the river. On the
12th at night orders had been given to Major Darley
to march with his regiment of Native cavalry towards
the Pass early in the morning, to support Major Child,
and he had not proceeded three miles, when he perceived
a large body of cavalry advancing, and was immediately
charged by them; being so much pressed on all sides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
he was obliged to take post and keep off the enemy
while his ammunition lasted, which was nearly expended,
when Colonel Floyd, with the remainder of the cavalry,
came to his support, to whom he had sent information
on first perceiving the enemy; this reinforcement fortunately
arrived just in time, as Major Darley’s regiment
was in a very dangerous situation.</p>

<p>Colonel Floyd, unperceived by Tippoo’s forces,
charged them in flank with three troops of the Nineteenth
light dragoons, supported by the remainder of the
regiment, entirely routed them, and pursued them to the
river; it was supposed that the enemy had nearly five
hundred killed on the ground, and a great number
drowned in endeavouring to recross the river, which
was fordable in very few places, while those were deep
and dangerous.</p>

<p>The infantry moved about two miles from the camp
in order to give support if necessary. The encampment
being confined, and change of situation requisite, orders
had been already issued for a change of ground, which
was situated about a mile from the position then
occupied, near to Damicotta; the tents were accordingly
struck early on the 13th of September.</p>

<p>Colonel Floyd, having dispersed the body of cavalry,
the troops were ordered to return to camp, which they
had not reached a quarter of an hour, when some guns
were opened from the opposite side of the river, whose
shot came direct into the lines: the lines immediately
turned out, and the tents, which were scarcely pitched,
were ordered to be struck. The enemy was perceived
in great force on both sides of the river; and three
columns, two of infantry and one of cavalry, on the
same side of the river with the British detachment,
could be distinguished marching with rapidity round
the left flank, which the foe seemed endeavouring to
penetrate; the opening of the guns on the opposite side,
and showing force there, being intended to withdraw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
attention from his intended attack, Colonel Floyd
moved out the infantry to a commanding ground, with
the British right towards the river, and the left extended
so as to cover <em>Sattimungulum</em>, and prevent the enemy
getting on his flank.</p>

<p>The first line consisted of the First Native battalion
on the right; the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> King’s regiment, the
Fifth and Twenty-fifth Native battalions on the left;
the cannon consisted of one eighteen-brass-pounder,
two twelve-pounders, and eight sixes.</p>

<p>The ground between the British and that occupied
by the forces of Tippoo Saib was low and intersected
with thick hedges; the British left was covered by
stony rugged ground, difficult of approach; the enemy
formed his line nearly parallel to the British, having his
left extended to the river at about twelve hundred
yards distance. Before the troops had well taken up
their position, the enemy opened some guns; the ground
was exceedingly stony, as was most of the county
adjacent, which in a great manner prevented Tippoo
making use of his cavalry during the day. The British
cavalry formed a second line, about half a mile in the
rear; the baggage was moved under the cover of some
hills about the same distance in the rear and on the
right flank of the cavalry; the enemy kept firing from
three or four guns from the opposite side of the river
during the whole of the day, the British right being
within shot of them, to which one battalion was fronted
to hinder him from crossing the river, as it was fordable
in that part. One native battalion (the sixteenth)
remained in the fort, where it had been stationed
some time.</p>

<p>When the cannonade first commenced it was about
eleven o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Soon after the British had taken
up their ground the enemy opened about sixteen guns,
and in a short time had the range of the line very
exactly. Colonel Deare, of the Bengal Artillery, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
was on the right giving some necessary directions, was
shot through the body shortly after the commencement
of the action. At about one o’clock the axletrees of the
two twelve-pounders broke, and rendered those two
guns useless; these were the best the British had for
the purpose.</p>

<p>Finding that the men were beginning to suffer very
much, as nearly every ball struck the line, Colonel
Floyd, not wishing to give up his advantageous position,
ordered the men to lie down, which preserved the lives
of several. The troops obeyed these directions, and
sustained with the greatest coolness and fortitude the
galling fire of the enemy. The cannonade continued
without the least intermission until it was quite dark,
about eight at night. Tippoo’s forces, supposing from
the inactivity of the British during the day that
a night attack was meditated, withdrew about six miles
back on the road by which they had advanced that
morning.</p>

<p>The British were not able to do the enemy much
injury, for the six-pounders scarcely reached his line;
the slaughter among the draught cattle was very great,
nearly two-thirds of them being killed. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
had Lieutenant Dennis Kelly Armstrong and
twenty-five men killed; Lieutenant John Vallancy and
about forty men were wounded.</p>

<p>When the cannonade ceased, every assistance was
given to the wounded; from the situation of the baggage
and stores no refreshment could be procured for the
men except a dram of arrack, the cattle carrying water
for the men having been mostly killed, and the drivers
fearing to come to the lines, water was much wanted.
A council of war was held during the night, in which it
was agreed to force a way through the enemy’s lines
about three o’clock in the morning of the 14th of
September, and join Major-General (afterwards Sir
William) Medows, to whom information had been sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
on the night of the 12th or morning of the 13th.
Every endeavour was made to repair the two twelve-pounders,
and settle the other guns so as to move; the
want of cattle was so great that it was impossible to
draw all the guns; the baggage was searched, and all
the private draught bullocks that could be obtained
were brought to the lines, but on trial would not move
the guns. The necessary instructions were given for
the march, which was to take place, from the left, in
the following manner:&mdash;The grenadiers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment to lead, provided with instruments for
spiking the enemy’s guns; the Twenty-fifth Native
battalion next, then the Fifth battalion; the battalion
companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment; the Sixteenth
and First Native battalions; the light company
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment in the rear. The
cavalry were to march in a separate column on the left.
The sixteenth battalion of sepoys was ordered to be
withdrawn from the fort about twelve at night, but did
not arrive until five, to which may be attributed the
engagement on the 14th, as the troops would otherwise
have been two hours’ march in advance of the enemy.
It was only found possible to repair one of the twelve-pounders,
and that with much exertion; upon collecting
all the bullocks that could be obtained, the eighteen-pounder,
two six-pounders, and two tumbrils were
obliged to be left on the ground, besides the broken
down twelve-pounder; one wheel of the eighteen-pounder
had been much damaged, as was the timber,
and one of the six-pounders; unfortunately the followers,
the people with the baggage, and the wounded, who
were moved behind one of the hills in the rear, being
out of danger, were not properly informed of the intended
march, and were left almost to the mercy of the
enemy’s horse. The first they knew of the movement
was seeing the line in motion, and every one then
endeavoured to make the best of his way to it; some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
of the dooly-men ran off, as did most of the followers,
leaving the sick and a great portion of the baggage on
the ground; when it was sufficiently light, it was
perceived that the enemy had left the position occupied
by him during the night. The British line moved off
about five o’clock, and was obliged to lift the guns on
by hand, which caused the troops to get on very slowly.
Before the ground had been well quitted, it was covered
by the enemy’s troops, who could be seen cutting down
every straggler they met; they came close on the rear,
annoying it as much as they could; all the wounded
and sick as were able to make their way to the line
were placed on the guns, and such officers’ horses as
could be found; in a short time the guns were laden
with them as much as could by any method be placed
on them, which much increased the difficulty of moving,
the soldiers being chiefly obliged to drag the guns.
The march was continued unmolested except by small
parties of horse, until the troops arrived within about
four miles of <em>Shawoor</em>, five miles from <em>Sattimungulum</em>.
The country was very close, and there being but one
road between two rugged hills, the British formed one
column, the cavalry leading; these moving faster than
the infantry had reached Shawoor, and were most of
them dismounted collecting forage, when Tippoo’s forces
were perceived on some rising ground on the right
flank, gaining on the British with great rapidity. The
centre of the line had just reached some rising ground,
when the enemy opened two guns; the second shot
killed and wounded four men of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment. The line kept still moving forward, the
enemy closing on it in all directions, his cavalry making
several charges in front, and particularly on the rear;
some of his infantry had by this time got very close
without being perceived, as the country was much
intersected with hedges, and annoyed the line greatly
with musketry and rockets, particularly the centre and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
rear. The line halted, and fronted the enemy. When
the British musketry commenced, the enemy’s horse had
formed completely round the troops, and were making
constant charges at the line in all directions, several
times coming close to the ranks; the most numerous
attacks were on the rear flank; the light company of
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> was much pressed, and several were
killed and wounded; this company continued the
arduous conflict until the ammunition was expended,
when charging with the bayonet Captain William
Hartley of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> was killed.</p>

<p>The light company was immediately relieved by a
battalion company of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, which was
again relieved by another company on the ammunition
being expended.</p>

<p>In this cool and spirited manner the engagement
was carried on for about two hours and a half with the
same regularity as on a common field day, when the
enemy’s cavalry, consisting of about two thousand, in
two dense columns, made a circuit and charged the
grenadier company, commanded by Captain Robert
Burne, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, but were effectually
checked by a steady and well-directed fire from the
company, which caused them to wheel off to the south.
During the engagement, and immediately after this
event, an officer of the British artillery, seeing a chief
of the enemy’s army mounted on an elephant encouraging
his troops on to the attack, directed his fire
against him, and killed him with the third shot. This
chief proved to be Bunham-ud-deen, the commander of
the army, and a near relative of the Sultan Tippoo Saib.</p>

<p>This event, in addition to the discouraging circumstance
of having been repulsed with considerable loss
in every attempt to break the British line, decided the
fate of the day; the enemy retired from the contest,
and by four o’clock in the afternoon left his opponents
complete masters of the field of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Floyd, with the cavalry, being a few miles
in advance, on the sudden appearance of the enemy’s
cavalry, and hearing from Colonel Oldham the situation
of the infantry, immediately formed line, and
charged the foe, who, dreading to come in contact with
the troops that had, in the early skirmish on the previous
day, given him such a severe specimen of their
prowess, moved off at too rapid a rate to be overtaken;
a pursuit was, however, kept up for some time, and,
after scouring the country for a distance round, the
troops were enabled to rest quietly during the night at
the village of Shawoor, where they arrived about
seven o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Colonel Floyd having during the action received
intelligence of the arrival of Major-General Medows
at Vellady that day, a distance of about twenty miles
from Shawoor, the march of the entire detachment was
in consequence directed to that village; and, moving off
at three o’clock in the morning of the 15th of September,
arrived there at sunset in the evening, quite overcome
by fatigue, thirst, and hunger.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, which had borne the
brunt of the contest, had no refreshment from the
evening of the 13th until late on that of the 15th of
September, excepting a supply of tobacco procured by
Lieutenant William Chambers, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
immediately after the action, from a cabin in the neighbourhood
of the line. The good qualities of this plant
are well known to soldiers and sailors, and under these
circumstances this timely supply proved a matter of
great importance to the men. It allayed their hunger
and thirst, revived their spirits, and afforded infinite
relief during the remainder of their long and fatiguing
march.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that Tippoo’s regular troops,
called the “Tiger Infantry,” were the attacking force
on this occasion, and were so named from their jackets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
having the emblem stripe of the royal tiger woven in
the cloth. A report was also current, that after the
battle Tippoo asked the officers why they had not
destroyed the Feringhee battalion; to which they
replied, that “they had done their best, but the battalion
wearing the colour of their prophet (the facings
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> being <em>green</em>), could not be vanquished
by any troops in the world.”</p>

<p>The army returned to Coimbatore on the 23d of
September. The Sultan, disappointed in his object
of destroying the divisions of the British army in detail,
resolved to attack the chain of depôts; he gained
possession of Errode and the stores at that place,
and afterwards marched southwards. The British
troops advanced from Coimbatore on the 29th of September,
and, arriving at Errode on the 4th of October,
found the place abandoned, and Tippoo’s army gone.
He had marched in the direction of Coimbatore; but,
hearing that the garrison was augmented, he advanced
rapidly upon Darraporam, against which the Sultan
opened his batteries on the 8th of October. The fort
had no cannon mounted, and the garrison, consisting
of a hundred Europeans and two hundred sepoys,
capitulated on honourable terms, to which the enemy
strictly adhered.</p>

<p>The British army moved on the 5th of October, and
on the 15th of that month encamped in the neighbourhood
of Coimbatore, where Lieut.-Colonel Stuart joined
from Palghautcherry, after having taken the place, and
left it in a tolerable state of defence. The pursuit of
the Sultan was continued, the troops traversing extensive
tracts of country, and undergoing much fatigue
under an Indian sun. In the middle of November the
army traversed the difficult pass of Tappoor, winding
through deep valleys, and dragging the guns over
precipices. Here the advance fell in with the rear of
Tippoo’s force, but could make no impression. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Sultan resolved to leave the British troops in his own
country, and to invade the Carnatic, which would
bring the English back for the defence of Trichinopoly.
Major-General Medows was about to carry offensive
plans into execution, when the movements of Tippoo
rendered it necessary to return to the Carnatic, and
the army arrived at the vicinity of Trichinopoly in the
middle of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791.</div>

<p>On the 1st of January 1791, the army arrived at
Terrimungulum, and on the 12th at Arnee. During
this long and fatiguing march the Anglo-Indian troops
frequently encamped upon the ground from which the
enemy had removed in the morning; but the efforts
made to overtake him were not successful. The sick
and heavy guns having been placed in the fort of
Arnee, on the 14th of January the advance and right
wing marched for Velhout, where they arrived on the
27th, followed by the left wing.</p>

<p>On the 29th of January the army was reviewed by
General Charles Earl Cornwallis, K. G., who had
arrived from Bengal to assume the command, and who
expressed great satisfaction at the appearance of the
troops. His Lordship was at this period Governor-General
and Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies,
and had quitted Bengal on the 6th of December of the
previous year, and landed at Fort St. George, Madras,
on the 30th of the same month.</p>

<p>The army arrived in the vicinity of Vellore on the
11th of February 1791, and the troops were ordered
into the fort. Tippoo was prepared to oppose any
attempt to penetrate into the country under his
dominion by the easiest passes; but Earl Cornwallis
contrived the appearance of a march towards Amboor,
which completely deceived the Sultan; and then turning
suddenly to the north, traversed the difficult pass of
Muglee, without the enemy having power to offer the
least obstruction, and arrived on the 20th of February<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
on the table-land of the Mysore country. Two days
afterwards the troops commenced their march towards
the strong fortress of <em>Bangalore</em>.</p>

<p>The following graphic description of the Fort of
Bangalore is extracted from Colonel Mark Wilks’s
History of the South of India:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Fort of Bangalore, entirely rebuilt of strong
masonry by Hyder and his son Tippoo, is nearly of
an oval form, with round towers at proper intervals,
and five powerful cavaliers, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fausse-braye</i>, a good
ditch and covered way without palisades, and some
well-furnished places of arms; but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">glacis</i> is imperfect
in several places; no part was entirely destitute
of the support of reciprocal fire, but in no part
was there a perfect flanking defence. There were
two gateways, one named the Mysore, the other the
Delhi gate; the latter opposite the pettah, overbuilt
by the projection of traverses, common to Indian
forts. The pettah, or town, of great extent, to the
north of the fort, was surrounded by an indifferent
rampart, and excellent ditch, with an intermediate
berm, if such it may be called, of nearly a hundred
yards wide, planted with impenetrable and well-grown
thorns; and this defence was only intermitted
exactly opposite the fort, where there was a slight
barrier, and an esplanade of insufficient extent. The
pettah had several gates, protected by a sort of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flêche</i>
at the end of each <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i> outside the ditch. Neither
the fort or pettah had drawbridges.”</p>
</div>

<p>An attack on the Delhi gate of the pettah was made
early in the morning of the 7th of March 1791 by
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, commanded by Captain
Andrew Wight, supported by the Third brigade of
sepoys, under Lieut.-Colonel Cockerell, and a few six-pounders
under Colonel Moorehouse. The zigzag approach
to the gate was scarcely twenty feet wide; two
field-pieces were opened on the gate, but that being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
supported behind by a piece of masonry-work, three
feet high and three feet thick, the shot, penetrating
through the gate above, had no effect in bringing it
down.</p>

<p>All this time the troops <ins class="corr" id="tn-52" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'were opposed to'">
were exposed to</ins> a destructive
shower of musketry from the turrets, on which a heavy
fire was kept up by the assailants, when two pieces of
ordnance were advanced, and their fire being directed
at the lower part of the gate and masonry work, shattered
it so much that, with the assistance of the troops,
a sufficient opening was made to admit one person to
enter, which happened to be Lieutenant John Eyre of
the light company of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment.
The soldiers continuing their exertions, at length pulled
down the gate, and immediately entered, when the
enemy fled with precipitation to the fort.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Eyre had received a sabre blow from a
cavalry soldier, which cut through his cap, wounded his
forehead, and knocked him down, but recovering his
feet immediately, he joined his company in pursuit of
the enemy. Shortly afterwards the enemy made a
great effort to retake the pettah, but being immediately
charged with the bayonet from street to street, were
driven back with considerable loss, and the British
were left in undisturbed possession of the town. In
this attack, Captain Jeremiah Delany, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
was killed.</p>

<p>The efforts of the troops were now directed to the
reduction of the fort,&mdash;and every preparation for the
approaching siege was carried on with diligence and
activity. On the 15th of March, the batteries being
completed, opened a fire upon <em>Bangalore</em>, and on the
17th the lines were cannonaded by the enemy, while at
night the camp was much disturbed by his rockets.</p>

<p>Forage became very scarce, and none could be procured
beyond the advanced piquets. The siege, however,
proceeded, and the enemy continued to harass the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
British until the 21st of March, when the breach being
considered practicable, an attack was ordered.</p>

<p>The storming party consisted of the grenadiers of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Fifty-second, Seventy-first, Seventy-second,
Seventy-fourth, and Seventy-sixth regiments,
followed by their respective light companies, and led
by Lieutenant James Duncan of the Seventy-first, and
Lieutenant John Evans of the Fifty-second, with a forlorn
hope of thirty chosen men; the whole supported by
the battalion companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Seventy-second,
and Seventy-sixth, with some battalions of
Bengal sepoys. The corps of attack were commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell of the Seventy-fourth, the
flankers immediately by Major Skelly; Major-General
Medows was present on the occasion.</p>

<p>The troops proceeded on this enterprise at eleven
o’clock on a fine moonlight night on the 21st of March,
and after a sharp conflict, by one o’clock in the morning
they became masters of the important fortress of <em>Bangalore</em>.</p>

<p>In the Orders issued on the following day, it was
stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lord Cornwallis</span> feels the most sensible gratification
in congratulating the officers and soldiers of
the army on the honourable issue of the fatigues and
dangers they have undergone during the late arduous
siege. Their alacrity and <em>firmness</em><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in the execution
of their various duties, has, perhaps, never been exceeded,
and he shall not only think it incumbent on
him to represent their meritorious conduct in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
strongest colours; but he shall ever remember it with
the sincerest esteem and admiration.</p>

<p>“The conduct of all the regiments which happened,
in their tour, to be on duty that evening, did credit
in every respect to their spirit and discipline; but <em>his
Lordship desires to offer the tribute of his particular
and warmest praise to the European grenadiers and
light infantry of the army, and to the</em> <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
<em>Seventy-second, and Seventy-sixth regiments, who led the
attack and carried the fortress, and who, by their behavior
on that occasion, furnished a conspicuous proof,
that discipline and valour in soldiers, when directed by
zeal and capacity in officers, are irresistible</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 28th of March the army quitted Bangalore
to join the forces of the Nizam, amounting to about
fifteen thousand cavalry, sent to co-operate with the
English in this war, and the junction was effected on
the 13th of April. The army afterwards returned to
Bangalore, where preparations were made for the siege
of Seringapatam; the troops advanced upon the capital
of the Mysore on the 4th of May, and on the 13th of
that month arrived at Arakerry, on the Cavery, about
eight miles below Seringapatam, which derived its name
from the god <em>Serung</em>, to whom one of the pagodas was
dedicated. The enemy was discernible in front, with
his right resting on the river, and his left on a high hill
named the Carighaut.</p>

<p>During the night of the 14th of May, the troops
marched with a view to surprise the enemy; but owing
to the badness of the weather and roads, together with
the jaded state of the gun-bullocks, little or no progress
was made during the night; but on the following day,
after having undergone great fatigue, they were brought
into action, when the enemy was driven from his strong
position, and forced across the river into the island upon
which the capital, Seringapatam, is situated, where he
was protected by his batteries. In this affair Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
John Turner was severely wounded, which caused
his death.</p>

<p>The army rested upon the field of battle, and was
again in movement on the 18th of May, and arrived
on the 20th at Canambaddy, situated on the Cavery,
some miles above Seringapatam. It was now ascertained
that the season was too far advanced for undertaking
immediately the siege of Tippoo’s capital, and
it was determined accordingly to withdraw. The battering
train was destroyed; all the ammunition and
stores were buried which could not be removed, and
on the 26th of May the army marched in the direction
of Bangalore.</p>

<p>Before commencing their retreat the soldiers were
thanked in orders for their conduct throughout these
services, and it was added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So long as there were any hopes of reducing
<em>Seringapatam</em> before the commencement of the heavy
rains, the Commander-in-Chief thought himself happy
in availing himself of their willing services; but the
unexpected bad weather for some time experienced
having rendered the attack of the enemy’s capital
impracticable until the conclusion of the ensuing
monsoons, Lord Cornwallis thought he should make
an ill return for the zeal and alacrity exhibited by
the soldiers, if he desired them to draw the guns and
stores back to a magazine, where there remains an
ample supply of both, which was captured by their
valour; he did not, therefore, hesitate to order the
guns, and stores which were not wanted for field
service, to be destroyed.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the course of this retreat the British were joined
by the Mahratta army, under Hurry Punt and Purseram
Bhow, consisting of about thirty-two thousand men,
chiefly cavalry, and thirty pieces of cannon. Of the
approach of this large force the British had been kept
in total ignorance by the active manner in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
communications were interrupted by Tippoo’s irregular
troops. Captain Little, having under his orders two
battalions of Bombay sepoys, joined with the Mahratta
army, and the supplies were now abundant.</p>

<p>The army arrived at Bangalore on the 11th of July,
and the enemy made no attempt whatever to interrupt
the march. By this time the Nizam’s cavalry had
become unfit to keep the field, and were allowed to
return to their own country. Purseram Bhow also,
with a large detachment of the Mahrattas, proceeded
into the Sera country; but Hurry Punt, with the remainder,
continued attached to the British army. On
the 15th of July the whole of the sick and one-half of
the tumbrils belonging to the field-pieces were sent into
the fort of Bangalore, and the army moved towards
Oussoor, where it arrived on the 11th of the following
month&mdash;the fort at that place being abandoned by the
enemy after he had blown up the angles thereof.</p>

<p>On the 12th of August the army moved from Oussoor
and on the 23d arrived at Bayeur. About this period
Major Gowdie, of the Honorable East India Company’s
service, was detached with some troops for the reduction
of the strong hill fort of <em>Nundydroog</em>, which it was found
required regular approaches. Major Gowdie arrived
before the place on the 22d of September.</p>

<p><em>Nundydroog</em>, the capital of a large and valuable
district, was built on the summit of a mountain about
one thousand seven hundred feet in height; three-fourths
of its circumference were absolutely inaccessible, and the
only face on which it could be ascended was protected
by two excellent walls and an outwork which covered
the gateway, and afforded a formidable flank fire. The
foundation for a third wall had been dug, but the Sultan
had not been able to have the plan completed.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and
Seventy-first regiments, under the command of Captain
James Robertson of the latter corps, marched on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
17th of October to join the detachment under Major
Gowdie, and, upon their arrival, were immediately
placed in the last parallel.</p>

<p>General the Earl Cornwallis, with a view to intimidate
the garrison, encamped with the army within four
miles of <em>Nundydroog</em>, on the 18th of October, and in
the evening of that day the troops were told off for an
assault upon the two breaches, which had been pronounced
practicable. The attacks commenced at eleven
o’clock at night, the grenadiers assaulting the right
breach and the light companies the left. The forlorn
hope of the right attack consisted of twenty grenadiers,
volunteers from the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and Seventy-first
regiments. Captain Robert Burne supported, with the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> grenadiers, the right attack, and Captain
William Hartley, with the light company of that regiment,
the left attack; Major-General Medows animated
the whole with his presence.</p>

<p>The assailants were soon discovered; blue lights
immediately illuminated the fort, and a heavy fire opened
from the works; this fire was fortunately ill-directed,
but the large stones hurled down the hill, and acquiring
great velocity as they bounded from the rock in their
descent, were extremely formidable. The storming
party, however, soon mounted the breaches, and pursuing
the enemy closely prevented his barricading the gate of
the inner wall. This was forced open, and the troops
entered. Captain Robertson, seeing that the place was
carried, used every endeavour to prevent the unnecessary
effusion of blood. The flank companies which formed
the storming party had two men killed and twenty-eight
wounded, the latter principally from bruises by the
stones thrown from the rock. The loss during the
siege amounted to forty Europeans and eighty sepoys
and pioneers, killed and wounded. At this place
Lieutenant John Eyre, of the regiment, died of his
wounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>In this manner <em>Nundydroog</em>, in the course of three
weeks, was taken, a place defended by seventeen pieces
of cannon, principally iron guns of large calibre; this
fort was not captured by Hyder Ali from the Mahrattas
until after a defence which lasted three years.</p>

<p>After the fall of Nundydroog, the other hill fort of
<em>Cumeldroog</em>, adjacent and dependent thereon, although a
place of great strength, surrendered on being summoned.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis, in General Orders of the 19th of
October, stated, that “having been witness of the
extraordinary obstacles, both of nature and art, which
were opposed to the detachment of the army that
attacked <em>Nundydroog</em>, he cannot too highly applaud
the firmness and exertions which were manifested by
all ranks in carrying on the operations of the siege,
or the valour and discipline which were displayed by
the flank companies of His Majesty’s <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
and Seventy-first regiments.”</p>

<p>In a few days afterwards the army retraced its route
to Bangalore. Savendroog and several hill forts were
captured by detachments in December, but the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment remained with the main body of the
army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792.</div>

<p>On the 31st of January 1792 the army under
General the Earl Cornwallis was reviewed by the
Poonah and Hyderabad chiefs, and on the following
day commenced its march towards <em><ins class="corr" id="tn-58" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Seringpatam'">
Seringapatam</ins></em>, passing
by Hooleadroog, Tajilly, and Carrycode. The troops
came in sight of Tippoo’s capital on the 5th of February,
and encamped at the French rocks. The enemy’s horse
showed itself on the 4th and 5th, but attempted nothing
hostile. The Sultan took up a formidable position to
cover his capital, and was attacked during the night of
the 6th of February.</p>

<p>The entrenched camp of Tippoo was reconnoitred on
the 6th of February, and at dark the army was formed
in three columns of attack. The right, under Major-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Medows, consisting of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and
Seventy-sixth King’s regiments. The centre under the
Commander-in-Chief, General the Earl Cornwallis,
consisting of the Fifty-second, Seventy-first, and Seventy-fourth
King’s regiments. The left, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Maxwell, of the Seventy-fourth, was composed
of the Seventy-second regiment. The native troops
were divided among the three columns.</p>

<p>The right column, to which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment was attached, under the command of Major-General
Medows, was directed to penetrate the left of
Tippoo’s line, and turning to the left, overthrow the
troops of the enemy there posted, and proceed on
until it joined Lord Cornwallis in the centre column, and
receive further orders; but the officer charged to guide
the column led it wrong, bringing it to the advanced
redoubt on the left of Tippoo’s lines, known by the
name of the <em>Ead-gah</em> redoubt,&mdash;which was mounted by
eight pieces of cannon, and was defended with great
bravery. The grenadiers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> rushed
steadily forward to escalade the work, with the officer
of engineers in charge of the scaling ladders, but a heavy
fire of grape shot and musketry killed most of the men
in charge of the ladders, which, being consequently
lost, it appeared impossible to enter the redoubt.</p>

<p>The work near the gorge had not been quite finished;
the troops again rushed forward, but the enemy’s fire
was so destructive as to sweep all opposed to it; a
momentary pause ensued, and at this crisis Captain
Andrew Wight, who commanded the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel the Honourable John
Knox having charge of a brigade, observing a narrow
pathway leading to the rampart, ordered his corps to
follow him, when the soldiers resumed the attack with
increased animation, and advancing with the bayonet
carried the work; only a few of the defenders escaped
instant death, and that by leaping from the embrasure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
into the ditch, which, from its height, must have proved
equally fatal to them. The loss of the enemy at the
Ead-gah redoubt was more considerable than at any
other post of his lines.</p>

<p>The loss in private men fell chiefly on the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
that regiment and the flank companies of the
Seventy-sixth being the troops which formed the front
division of the column. The grenadiers of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
who led, in advancing to the redoubt, had
twenty men killed and wounded.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>After leaving a sufficient force in this strongwork,
including four companies of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, under
Captain John Austin, who had commanded the leading
company of the column, the troops under Major-General
Medows moved to the left, intending to fall on the
enemy’s left wing, instead of which they came in view
of another redoubt of equal strength and magnitude
with the former, which it was deemed imprudent to
attack. The column then recrossed the bound-hedge,
moved to the left of the British army, which it did
not find until daybreak, when the action was over.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis, on joining Major-General Medows
at the Pagoda hill, on the morning of the 7th of
February, detached the remaining six companies of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment and the third battalion of
Bengal sepoys towards the Sultan’s redoubt; but they
were afterwards ordered to proceed to the island, where
the enemy had commenced an attack on the troops,
which was gallantly repulsed.</p>

<p>The foregoing details show what an active part the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> sustained in these operations, and testify
the share which the regiment deserved of the following
general commendation bestowed by the Earl Cornwallis
in his orders issued on the evening of the 7th of
February.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conduct and valour of the officers and soldiers
of this army have often merited Lord Cornwallis’s
encomiums; but the zeal and gallantry which were
so successfully displayed last night in the attack of
the enemy’s whole army, in a position that had cost
him so much time and labour to fortify, can never be
sufficiently praised; and his satisfaction on an occasion,
which promises to be attended with the most
substantial advantages, has been greatly heightened
by learning from the commanding officers of divisions,
that this meritorious behaviour was universal
through all ranks, to a degree that has rarely been
equalled.</p>

<p>“Lord Cornwallis, therefore, requests that the army
in general will accept of his most cordial thanks for
the noble and gallant manner in which they have
executed the plan of the attack. It covers themselves
with honour, and will ever command his warmest
sentiments of admiration.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the assault of Tippoo Sultan’s fortified camp and
island of Seringapatam on the 6th and 7th of February
1792, the total loss of the right division, under Major-General
Medows, including officers, amounted to twenty-seven
killed and sixty-five wounded. Lieutenant
Alexander David Robertson, of the Seventy-third,
doing duty with the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, from which he had
been promoted, and Ensign Pooley Smith, of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, were killed. Lieutenants Thomas
Brownrigg, Robert Campbell, and John Campbell,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, were wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>The enemy’s loss was very severe, being estimated
at 20,000 <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>. Eighty pieces of cannon were
taken by the British.</p>

<p>On the 9th of February the army took up its final
position for the siege of <em>Seringapatam</em>, and on the 15th
Major-General Robert Abercromby joined with the
Bombay force, consisting of the Seventy-third, Seventy-fifth,
and Seventy-seventh regiments, beside native
troops, making a total of about six thousand men.</p>

<p>Preparations were now made for the siege of Seringapatam,
and the approaches were carried on with the
greatest activity until the 24th of February, when the
general orders announced that the preliminary articles
of peace had been signed, and in consequence all hostile
measures immediately ceased.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February the two sons of Tippoo
Saib, Abdel Kalek and Mooza-ud-Deen, the former
ten years of age, and the latter eight, were brought to
the British camp, as hostages for the due performance
of the preliminary articles.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of some obstacles which had been
opposed by Tippoo to the arrangement of the definitive
Treaty, working parties were ordered, and the guns
replaced in the batteries on the 10th of March. This
state of suspicion and preparation lasted until the 15th
of March, when it was discontinued, and on the 18th of
that month, the definitive Treaty being duly executed
and signed, was delivered by the young Abdel Kalek
to each of the confederates. On the 20th the counterpart
was sent off to Tippoo Saib.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Thus terminated a war in which the confederates
wrested from the enemy seventy fortresses, eight
hundred pieces of cannon, and destroyed or dispersed
at least fifty thousand men. By the articles of the
Treaty Tippoo was bound to pay a large sum of money
and to cede one half of his dominions.</p>

<p>The Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief in
India granted from this money a sum equal to six
months’ batta for all ranks, and the Court of Directors
afterwards made a similar grant.</p>

<p>On the 26th of March the exchange of the definitive
treaty being completed, the British commenced moving
towards Bangalore, from whence they proceeded to the
Pednaigdurgum Pass, where the Bengal troops were
ordered to their own Presidency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793.</div>

<p>The French revolution, which had commenced a few
years previously, had at this period assumed a character
which called forth the efforts of other countries to arrest
the progress of its destructive principles; and, on the
1st of February 1793, shortly after the decapitation of
Louis XVI., war was declared by the National Convention
of France against Great Britain and Holland.</p>

<p>News of this event arrived in India in May 1793;
in June the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment was ordered to
prepare to take the field; it marched soon afterwards
against the French settlement of <em>Pondicherry</em>, on the
Coromandel coast; the troops employed on this service
were commanded by Colonel John Brathwaite.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Pondicherry</em> was commenced in the
early part of August, the army encamping in a thick
wood where tigers were so numerous that the natives
durst not travel in the night. On the 22d of August
a white flag was displayed by the garrison, with a
request to be allowed to surrender. The French soldiers
in the fortress had embraced democratical principles,
and were particularly insubordinate; they insisted that
the Governor should surrender; but after the white<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
flag was displayed, they fired two shells, which killed
several men. During the night they were guilty of
every species of outrage: breaking into houses, and
becoming intoxicated. On the following morning a
number of them environed the house of the Governor-General
Charmont, and threatened to hang him before
the door, when application was made to the British for
protection. The English soldiers rushed into the town,
overpowered the insurgents, rescued the Governor, and
preserved the inhabitants from further violence. After
this service the regiment returned to Madras.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1794.</div>

<p>During the year 1794 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
was stationed at Trichinopoly.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1795.</div>

<p>In 1795 the regiment proceeded to Negapatam.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1796.</div>

<p>During the years 1796 and 1797 the regiment was
stationed at Warriore, near Trichinopoly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798.<br />1799.</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1798 the regiment was stationed
at Pondicherry, and subsequently at Wallahabad. The
men fit for service were afterwards drafted into the
Seventy-fourth and Seventy-sixth regiments, and the
remainder of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> embarked at Madras
for Europe on the 15th of October 1798. Previously to
the regiment returning to England, orders were issued
by the Governor in Council, and by the Commander-in-Chief
of Madras, dated 24th of September and 14th
of October 1798, which are highly complimentary of
the regiment, and are inserted at <a href="#Page_121">page 121</a> of the
Appendix. The want of convoy caused the fleet of
Indiamen to be detained three months at St. Helena,
and the regiment did not arrive in England until the
26th of July 1799, when it landed at Greenhithe;&mdash;it
subsequently proceeded to Cirencester, and thence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
to Winchester, where the corps was completed to its
establishment by volunteers from the militia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment embarked at Portsmouth,
in January 1800, for Ireland, and disembarked
at Tarbert and Cork; it afterwards proceeded to Fermoy,
Clonmel, and thence to Cork, where the regiment
embarked with an expedition under Brigadier-General
the Honorable Sir Thomas Maitland, and landed in
the beginning of June at the Isle de Houat, on the
coast of France; on the 4th of June the light company
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment landed at <em>Quiberon</em>, and
destroyed some batteries, after which it re-embarked for
the Mediterranean, and the regiment arrived at Minorca
in July, which island had surrendered to Great Britain
in November 1798.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1801.</div>

<p>During the year 1801 the regiment was stationed at
Minorca.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802.</div>

<p>On the 27th of March 1802 a treaty of peace was
signed at Amiens between the French Republic, Spain,
and the Batavian Republic on the one part, and Great
Britain on the other; by this treaty the Island of
Minorca was restored to Spain.</p>

<p>In August 1802 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment returned
to Cork from Minorca, marched to Galway,
and occupied the barracks at that place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803.</div>

<p>The conduct of Napoleon Bonaparte had occasioned
hostilities to be renewed in May 1803, when the
British army was augmented, and preparations were
made to repel a threatened invasion by the French.
The “<em>Army of Reserve Act</em>” was passed in June 1803
for raising men for home service by ballot; and numerous
volunteer and yeomanry corps were formed in
every part of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>The regiment was suddenly ordered to proceed by
forced marches from Galway to Dublin in July 1803,
where a serious riot had occurred on the 23d of that
month, when Lord Chief Justice Kilwarden, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
nephew the Rev. Richard Wolfe, were attacked in his
carriage, and murdered by the rioters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804.</div>

<p>On the 18th of May 1804 Napoleon was invested
with the dignity of Emperor of the French; and on
the 26th of May of the following year he was crowned
King of Italy, at Milan.</p>

<p>Further measures of defence were adopted by Great
Britain, and the “<em>Additional Force Act</em>” was passed
on the 29th of June 1804, by which a second battalion
was added to the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, to be formed
of men raised in the county of Durham for limited
service; the second battalion was placed on the establishment
of the army from the 25th of December
following.</p>

<p>On the 12th of December 1804 the Court of Spain
issued a declaration of war against England, in consequence
of the capture of some frigates off Cadiz, which
had been intercepted on their way to France with
cargoes of treasure for the use of Napoleon, Spain
having agreed to furnish a powerful aid to that ruler.</p>

<p>During the year 1804 the first battalion of the regiment
continued in garrison at Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805.</div>

<p>On the 3d of August 1805 the first battalion of the
regiment marched from Dublin, having been selected
to form part of the army under Lieut.-General Lord
Cathcart; it encamped on the Curragh of Kildare
until the 20th of September, marched from thence to
Bandon, and occupied the barracks there; on the
29th of October the battalion embarked at Cork for
Germany.</p>

<p>The second battalion remained in Great Britain
during 1805, and three following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806.</div>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
arrived in Germany on the 1st of January 1806, and
occupied cantonments in Bramstead and Bokell until
February, when it again marched and embarked for
Great Britain, the British troops having been recalled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
to England in consequence of the events which followed
Napoleon’s victory over the Russians and Austrians at
Austerlitz in December of the preceding year;&mdash;the
battalion landed at Ramsgate early in March.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1806 the first battalion was
directed to proceed to Portsmouth for the purpose of
joining the expedition under Brigadier-General Robert
Craufurd, about to be employed on secret service; and
the battalion embarked at Portsmouth on the 22d of
September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807.</div>

<p>The expedition, which consisted of the first battalions
of the Fifth, <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Forty-fifth, and Eighty-eighth
regiments, five companies of the Rifle corps,
two squadrons of the Sixth dragoon guards, and two
companies of Royal Artillery, did not sail from Falmouth
until the 12th of November 1806; and after
remaining at St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde Islands,
from the 14th of December 1806 to the 11th of January
1807, arrived in Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope,
on the 22d of March following. Here the troops were
landed for refreshment and exercise under Brigadier-General
Craufurd. From the Cape the expedition
sailed again on the 6th of April; reached St. Helena
on the 21st of April, where the stock of water and
provisions was completed; and, quitting that island on
the 26th, arrived on the 14th of June at <em>Monte Video</em>,
then occupied by the British troops under Lieut.-General
John Whitelocke, who had arrived there in
the preceding May, and had assumed the command of
the whole British force in South America.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>Great preparations were made to effect a landing of
the troops, which took place on the 28th of June at
<em>Ensenada da Baragon</em>, about thirty-two miles distant
from Buenos Ayres, without firing a shot. The first
battalions of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and Eighty-eighth
regiments were brigaded together under the orders
of Brigadier-General the Honourable William Lumley.
On the 29th the troops moved forward; the light
brigade, composed of the Rifle corps and nine light
infantry companies, formed the advance, which was
supported by Brigadier-General Lumley’s brigade, and
followed by the other corps in succession. On the
1st of July the army was concentrated near the village
of Reduction, about seven miles from Buenos Ayres,
from whence it again advanced on the following day,
crossed the Chuelo, a rivulet, by a ford called the
Chico, and traversed the low ground on the opposite
bank, at the extremity of which is situated the City of
Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The light company was at the attack and carrying
of the enemy’s advance field-work on the 2d of July;
on the 5th of that month the right wing of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Robert Burne,
and the left wing by Captain William Cross, stormed
and established themselves in Buenos Ayres. Upon
this severe service Captains Alexander, Williamson,
and Henry Cole Johnson, with Lieutenant Robert
Whittell, two serjeants, one drummer, and forty-one
rank and file, were killed; Captains William Wright
Swain and Henry Vernon, Lieutenants William
Wingfield, William Cotton, John Chaloner, and John
White, seven serjeants, and thirty-six rank and file,
were wounded.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the intrepidity displayed by the
advancing troops, upon whom a destructive fire was
poured from the tops of houses and every other advantageous
position, the enterprise failed. On the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
morning the Governor-General Liniers sent a letter
to Lieut.-General Whitelocke, offering to restore the
prisoners taken in this action, and also those made
with Brigadier-General Beresford, on condition that
the whole of the British forces should be withdrawn
from South America, which proposals were accepted.
The Lieut.-General’s conduct subsequently became
the subject of inquiry by a Court-martial, and he was
cashiered.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the regiment re-embarked at
Buenos Ayres, and descended the River Plate to
<em>Monte-Video</em>, whence it embarked on the 9th of September
for Europe, and arrived at Cork on the 17th of
December following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808.</div>

<p>The battalion occupied the barracks at Cork until
February 1808, when it proceeded to Fermoy, where it
remained until the 5th of July, when it marched to
Cork for embarkation, having been selected to form
part of a force, under the command of Lieut.-General
the Honorable Sir Arthur Wellesley, destined to proceed
to the Peninsula to aid the Spanish and Portuguese
patriots in their efforts against Napoleon, who
had placed his brother Joseph on the throne of Spain,
and was endeavouring to reduce the Peninsula under
his domination.</p>

<p>In May 1808 the second battalion proceeded to
Jersey, but returned to England in July following.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July the first battalion embarked at
Cork, and landed at Figuiera, in Portugal, on the 1st of
August. The battalion under the command of Brevet
Colonel Robert Burne, advanced with the troops under
Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir Arthur Wellesley
towards Lisbon. The division, consisting of about
four thousand men, under Major-General Sir Brent
Spencer, K.B., having joined the army from Cadiz, a
change was made in the arrangement of the brigades,
and the first battalions of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Fortieth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
and Seventy-first regiments were placed in that commanded
by Major-General Ronald Craufurd Ferguson.
After a short halt the army was again put in motion to
occupy a more forward position, where it remained for
some days. On the 17th of August the enemy, commanded
by General Laborde, was encountered near
<em>Roleia</em>. The first battalion under the command of
Colonel Robert Burne shared in this action, Captain
William Cross being detached in charge of three companies.
The position was attacked and carried, with
great loss to the French, who retreated on Torres
Vedras.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> subsequently received the Royal
Authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Roleia</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of
this victory.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir Arthur Wellesley,
after this battle, did not pursue the enemy by the high
roads, but keeping to the right near the sea marched to
<em>Vimiera</em>, to cover the landing of a brigade commanded
by Major-General Anstruther, which was effected on
the 20th of August.</p>

<p>The morning of the 21st of August was given up to
the troops in order to prepare and repose themselves.
The men were engaged in washing and cleaning their
equipments when the approach of the enemy, moving
to the left, was discovered at eight o’clock in the
morning; and the brigades commanded by Major-General
Ferguson, Brigadier-Generals Nightingall,
Acland, and Bowes, were consequently moved across
a valley from the heights on the west to those on the
east of Vimiera.</p>

<p>Marshal Junot, Duke of Abrantes, moved his army
to the attack of the position, and commenced it on
the British centre, where the Fiftieth regiment was
posted, moving along the front gradually to the left,
until the whole line became engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> had the good fortune to take a
distinguished share in the battle of <em>Vimiera</em> on the 21st
of August; and the gallantry of the battalion was particularly
noticed by Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir
Arthur Wellesley in the General Orders of that day.</p>

<p>The battalion had nine rank and file killed; Captain
Paul Minchin Hobart; Lieutenants H. S. Hart,
Thomas Wright, and Walter Ewart; Ensign Peter
Joseph Bone; Lieutenant and Adjutant John Povah,
and twenty-three rank and file, were wounded.</p>

<p>The conduct of the battalion and of its commanding
officer, Colonel Burne, was thus specially noticed by
Lieut.-General the Honorable Sir Arthur Wellesley in
his despatch of the 21st of August;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In mentioning Colonel Burne, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, to you upon this occasion, I cannot
avoid to add that the regular and orderly conduct of
this corps throughout this service, and their gallantry
and discipline in action have been conspicuous.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter dated 22d of August 1808 (inserted in
the Appendix, <a href="#Page_122">page 122</a>), addressed to Viscount Castlereagh,
Secretary of State, Lieut.-General the Honorable
Sir Arthur Wellesley bore further testimony to the
merits of Colonel Burne, and stated, that “<em>the</em> <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
<em>regiment is an example to the army</em>.”</p>

<p>The thanks of both Houses of Parliament were conferred
on the troops, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> subsequently
received the Royal Authority to bear the word
“<span class="smcap">Vimiera</span>” on the regimental colour and appointments
in commemoration of this battle.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The “<em>Convention of Cintra</em>” was the result of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
victory, and it was signed on the 30th of August;
by its provisions the French army evacuated Portugal,
which country became freed from its oppressors.</p>

<p>The British army was ordered to move forward to
Lisbon, some of the reinforcements for it having proceeded
by water, and occupied the forts at the mouth
of the Tagus. The French army having by this convention
fallen back on Lisbon, the British proceeded
to the vicinity of Fort St. Julien, and encamped.</p>

<p>All the objects of the expedition being carried into
effect, and the French troops embarked for France, the
British army remained for some time at Lisbon and
its vicinity. At this period (September) Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore, having assumed the command, made
dispositions for entering Spain.</p>

<p>The first battalions of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Seventy-first,
and Ninety-second regiments were brigaded under
Brigadier-General Catlin Craufurd, and placed in the
division under the command of Lieut.-General the
Honorable John Hope, afterwards the Earl of Hopetoun.
On the 27th of October the division was put in
motion, and after a short stay at Badajoz resumed the
march to Talavera-de-la-Reyna. From this town the
column proceeded to the Escurial, seven leagues to the
north-west of Madrid, where it arrived and halted on
the 22d of November.</p>

<p>Intelligence was here received of the enemy’s approach
towards Madrid; the division was in consequence
put in motion across the Guadarama mountains on the
27th of November towards Villa Castin, at which place
Lieut.-General the Honorable John Hope, in consequence
of the information he received of the enemy’s
movements, made a night march to the left, by Avila
and Peneranda, and finally proceeded to Alba-de-Tormes,
where a junction was formed with a detachment
from the army under Lieut.-General Sir John Moore,
then at Salamanca. The army under Sir John Moore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
was shortly afterwards put in motion towards Valladolid,
and subsequently to the left, to effect a junction with
Lieut.-General Sir David Baird’s division, which had
landed at Corunna.</p>

<p>Previously to this period, the Spanish armies under
General Blake, near Bilboa on the left, General Castanos
in the centre, and General Palafox lower down the
Ebro on the right, had been completely defeated;
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore consequently made
arrangements for a retreat on Portugal by Ciudad
Rodrigo, but it having been represented to him that
Madrid held out against the French, he was induced to
form a junction with Lieut.-General Sir David Baird,
in order to make a diversion in favour of Madrid, by
attacking Marshal Soult on the river Carion.</p>

<p>The British force, twenty-nine thousand strong,
joined at Toro on the 21st of December, and on the
23d of that month Sir John Moore advanced with the
whole army. The cavalry had already met with that
of the enemy, and the infantry were within two hours
march of him, when an intercepted letter informed the
British commander that Napoleon, who had entered
Madrid on the 4th of December, was then in full march
for Salamanca and Benevente. A retreat on Corunna,
through Gallicia, was immediately decided on, that
through Portugal being then impracticable.</p>

<p>Accordingly the several divisions marched towards
the Esla, the greater part crossing by the bridge of
Benevente on the 26th of December, when, after a
day’s halt, the cavalry, under Lieut.-General Lord
Paget and Brigadier-General the Honorable Charles
Stewart, had an engagement with some of the Imperial
guards that had forded the river Esla under General
LeFevre, who was made prisoner with several of his men.</p>

<p>At this period the situation of the British army was
dispiriting in the extreme. In the midst of winter, in
a dreary and desolate country, the soldiers chilled and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
drenched with the heavy rains, and wearied by long
and rapid marches, were almost destitute of fuel to cook
their victuals, and it was with extreme difficulty that
they could procure shelter. Provisions were scarce,
irregularly issued, and difficult of attainment. The
waggons, in which were their magazines, baggage, and
stores, were often deserted in the night by the Spanish
drivers, who were terrified by the approach of the
French. Thus baggage, ammunition, stores, and even
money were destroyed to prevent them falling into the
hands of the enemy; and the weak, the sick, and the
wounded were necessarily left behind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809.</div>

<p>On the 5th of January 1809, the troops took up a
position at Lugo, where they remained bivouacked in
order of battle until the 9th of that month, when they
marched in the night, and arrived at <em>Corunna</em> on the
11th of January. The British army, having accomplished
one of the most celebrated retreats recorded in
modern history, repulsing the pursuing enemy in all his
attacks, and having traversed two hundred and fifty
miles of mountainous country under very disheartening
circumstances, accompanied by severe privation, was
not destined to embark for England without a battle.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, having taken up
a position above the town of <em>Corunna</em>, made arrangements
for attacking the British army as soon as the
troops should commence their embarkation. The sick
men, the women, and baggage having been conveyed
on board ship, preparations were made for embarking
the troops on the 16th of January 1809. The French
instantly descended from the heights, and advanced,
about two o’clock, to attack the British position in front
of <em>Corunna</em>; a sanguinary action ensued, and before
dark the French were defeated in all their attacks.
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore was killed, and the
battle was scarcely ended, when, wrapped in a military
cloak, his remains were interred in the citadel of Corunna,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
over which Marshal Soult, with the chivalrous
feeling of a true soldier, erected a monument.</p>

<p>This victory enabled the British troops to be embarked
without further molestation. In this battle the
first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> was posted on the
left of the British line.</p>

<p>During the retreat to <em>Corunna</em>, and its services there,
the battalion had Lieutenant John White wounded, and
one serjeant and two rank and file killed; one serjeant,
three drummers, and one hundred and fifty-three rank
and file, were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>In commemoration of this battle, and of the conduct
of the battalion during the expedition, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
in common with the army employed under
Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, received the Royal
authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Corunna</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The army also received the thanks of both Houses
of Parliament “for its distinguished discipline, firmness,
and valour in the battle of <span class="smcap">Corunna</span>.”</p>

<p>On the 17th of January the battalion embarked at
Corunna for England; portions landed at Plymouth,
Portsmouth, and Deal, but the several divisions were
assembled at Battle, in Sussex, during the month of
February.</p>

<p>Immense preparations had been made by the British
Government to fit out the most formidable armament
that had for a long time proceeded from England. The
troops amounted to forty thousand men, commanded
by Lieut.-General the Earl of Chatham; the naval portion
consisted of thirty-nine ships of the line, thirty-six
frigates, and numerous gun-boats and bomb-vessels, and
other small craft, under Admiral Sir Richard Strachan.
The object of the expedition was to obtain possession<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
of the islands at the mouth of the <em>Scheldt</em>, and to destroy
the French ships in that river, with the docks
and arsenals at Antwerp. The first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment received orders to prepare
itself for this service, and on the 16th of July embarked
at Portsmouth for <em>Walcheren</em>, under the command
of Colonel Burne. The expedition sailed from
the Downs on the 28th of July, and on the morning
of the 1st of August the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> and other corps
were landed, and on the same day the troops advanced
to the investment of <em>Flushing</em>, which operation was
warmly contested by the enemy.</p>

<p>By the 13th of August, the preparations for the
attack on the town were completed, and on the
night of the 14th one of the enemy’s batteries, advanced
upon the sea dyke in front of Lieut.-General
Alexander Mackenzie Fraser’s position, was most
gallantly carried at the point of the bayonet by detachments
from the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Seventy-first, and
the light battalions of the King’s German legion,
under Lieut.-Colonel Denis Pack, of the Seventy-first,
although opposed to great superiority of numbers; the
troops took forty prisoners, and killed and wounded a
great many of the enemy. <em>Flushing</em> capitulated on
the 15th of August; the garrison becoming prisoners
of war.</p>

<p>From the 8th to the 15th of August the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
had three rank and file killed; Major Alexander
Mackenzie was dangerously wounded; two serjeants
and seven rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>An epidemic disease of a fatal character broke out
among the troops, and the following officers and men
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment died of fever:&mdash;Captains
Waddle, C. Douglas, and Alexander Barbor,
Lieutenant McDermott, Assistant-Surgeon James
McFarlane, fourteen serjeants, two drummers, and
two hundred rank and file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>On the 10th of December 1809 the first battalion
embarked for England, and arrived at Woolwich on
the 22d of that month; it subsequently returned to
Battle in Sussex.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1810.</div>

<p>During the year 1810 the first battalion was stationed
at Battle.</p>

<p>The second battalion was moved from Worcester to
Kidderminster in the spring, and in the summer to
Cirencester, and subsequently to Horsham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811.</div>

<p>The first battalion occupied the barracks at Battle
until January 1811, on the 28th of which month it
embarked at Portsmouth under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
the Honorable Basil Cochrane on board His
Majesty’s ship “Victory,” and landed at Lisbon on
the 5th of March. The battalion immediately joined
in the pursuit of Marshal Massena from Santarem,
and was in position at the expulsion of the enemy from
Guarda on the 29th of March.</p>

<p>The battalion was next employed in the blockade of
<em>Almeida</em>, and Marshal Massena, having concentrated
his forces, crossed the Agueda on the 2d of May for
the purpose of relieving the place. This movement
led to the actions at <em>Fuentes d’Onor</em> on the 3d and 5th
of May. In the battle of the 5th the battalion was
in position, but was not actively engaged. The French
were defeated, after a prolonged contest, and Marshal
Massena left <em>Almeida</em> to its fate. The place was evacuated
by General Brennier at midnight of the 10th of
May, when the enemy blew up the works, and the
greater part of the garrison succeeded in effecting its
escape during the night.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, when the garrison of <em>Almeida</em>
effected its escape through the corps on duty, Lieut.-Colonel
the Honorable Basil Cochrane, with about
half of the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment,
had the good fortune to come up with the French
at the bridge of <em>Barba del Puerco</em>; and, in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
with the Grenadier company of the Fourth foot under
Captain Thomas Burke, caused them considerable loss.
Many were killed and wounded, and three hundred
were taken prisoners, but the rest escaped.</p>

<p>The remainder of the battalion took another road in
the pursuit, under the orders of Brigadier-General
Robert Burne, Lieut.-Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
and intercepted many stragglers, whom they made
prisoners.</p>

<p>The casualties under Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Basil Cochrane were two killed;&mdash;Lieutenant Charles
Moody and eight rank and file were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Early in June 1811 the battalion commenced its
march for the south of Portugal, and continued at the
camp of Arronches until the 18th of July, when it again
returned to the north, and was in cantonments at Barquilla,
in Spain, during August and September; on the
25th of September it was in position at the affair of
<em>Especha</em>, when the enemy advanced to relieve <em>Ciudad
Rodrigo</em>, which was blockaded by the Allied army.
The battalion was likewise in position at the subsequent
affair near <em>Ronda</em> on the 27th of September.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September the British army went
into cantonments, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> occupying the
village of Pinziu. There Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable
Basil Cochrane found his health so much on the
decline that he was compelled to apply for leave to
return to England; and on the 13th of October he
quitted the corps for that purpose, the command of
which then devolved on Major William Cross.</p>

<p>On the 24th of November the battalion <ins class="corr" id="tn-78" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'marched ot Gallegos'">
marched to Gallegos</ins>, in Spain, with the view of intercepting a convoy
of provisions intended for the garrison of Ciudad
Rodrigo, but the incessant rain had so flooded the rivers
that it was found impossible to cross at the points intended,
which circumstance enabled the convoy to reach
its destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>The battalion commenced its march to new cantonments
at Mongualda on the 27th of November, which
it reached on the 3d of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812.</div>

<p>On the 14th of January 1812 the battalion was
moved from Mongualda, by forced marches, to assist in
the siege of <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, which, however, was taken
on the night of the 19th of January by the troops under
Viscount Wellington, just as the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> were
on the point of leaving Nava d’Aver, within ten miles
of the scene of operations; the battalion remained at
Nava d’Aver until Ciudad Rodrigo was secured against
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i>, and then marched into cantonments at
Meda, which it reached on the 3d of February.</p>

<p>Major-General Henry Clinton arrived and assumed the
command of the sixth division on the 11th of February.
On the 20th of that month the battalion marched for
the south of Portugal, reached Estremos on the 6th of
March, and remained there until the 14th, on which
day it proceeded to Borba, and on the 15th to the
camp at Elvas, where the army was assembled. On
the following day it marched to aid in investing <em>Badajoz</em>,
and from thence proceeded with the covering army,
under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham (afterwards
Lord Lynedoch), which, after the affairs of Usagré,
Llerena, Berlonga, and Asuaga, effected the expulsion
of the enemy from Spanish Estremadura, and then
returned to support the attack on <em>Badajoz</em>. The battalion
reached Albuhera on the 6th of April, on the
night of which Badajoz was stormed and carried.</p>

<p>The enemy being thus thwarted in all his views
against the south, in which the principal part of the
British troops was assembled, made a sudden invasion
of the north of Portugal, and advanced as far as Castello
Branco. The sixth division was in consequence moved
with the utmost rapidity in that direction, but on its
approach the enemy retired, and the division again
returned to the south, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
up cantonments at Castello de Vide on the 30th
of April.</p>

<p>On the 5th May 1812, Lieut.-Colonel Lewis Davies arrived,
and assumed the command of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>;
towards the end of the month Major William Cross,
who had been in very bad health for several weeks,
proceeded to join the second battalion in England.</p>

<p>The battalion marched to Azumar on the 8th of May,
and on the 13th to Arronches, from which it moved
towards the end of the month to Puebla, in Spain,
then to Badajoz, where it halted five days, thence to
Castello de Vide for two days, from which it marched
through Castello Branco in the direction of Salamanca,
which it reached on the 17th of June, and operations
were then immediately commenced against the Forts at
Salamanca by the light companies of the division under
Colonel Samuel Venables Hinde, of the Thirty-second
regiment. They were attacked without success on the
23d, and carried on the 27th of June by a party under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Davies, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
with a loss to the battalion of Lieutenant
George Mackenzie and eleven rank and file killed, and
Captain Paul Minchin Hobart and twenty-five rank
and file wounded. Captain Hobart, who was promoted
to the brevet rank of Major on the 23d of July 1812,
died of his wounds.</p>

<p>The battalion then occupied different villages in the
neighbourhood, and on the 22d of July it took a considerable
share in the battle of Salamanca. The change
of the allied position and various manœuvres occupied
the day without any close engagement, excepting on
the left for the possession of the Arapiles; the battle of
<em>Salamanca</em> did not commence in earnest until after three
o’clock, when the French left, having been very much
extended by the advance of the division of General
Thomières, with the light cavalry and fifty pieces of
artillery, along a range of heights parallel with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
British line, to cut off the right of the allies from the
Ciudad Rodrigo road, the third division was ordered to
advance in four columns, supported by cavalry to
turn the French left. The evolutions of this great
battle are too varied to be clearly described with
brevity. The sixth division under Major-General
Clinton, of which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> formed part, was
placed at first in reserve, but at a critical period in
the action it was ordered up to relieve the fourth
division, and the battle was soon restored to its former
success.</p>

<p>The enemy’s right, reinforced by the troops which
had fled from his left, and by those which had by this
time retired from the Arapiles, still continued to resist;
and while other corps were directed to turn the right,
the sixth division, supported by the third and fifth,
attacked the front. It was dark before this point was
carried by the sixth division, and the enemy then fled
through the woods towards the Tormes.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir William Napier, in his History
of the Peninsular War, thus sums up the account of
this victory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The battle of Salamanca, remarkable in many
points of view, was not least so in this, that it was
the first decided victory gained by the allies in the
Peninsula. In former actions the French had been
repulsed, here they were driven headlong, as it were,
before a mighty wind, without help or stay, and the
results were proportionate.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> had Captains William Tulloh
and Alexander Middleton, Lieutenants Arthur Parker
and Richard Barton, one serjeant, and fifteen rank and
file killed. Brevet-Major John Fox, Lieutenants Walter
Ewart, and David Price, Ensigns Richard James
Bourchier, William Wainwright, with four serjeants
and seventy rank and file, were wounded. Lieutenant
Ewart subsequently died of his wounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Davies obtained the medal issued for
the victory gained at Salamanca; and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
subsequently received the Royal Authority to
bear the word “<span class="smcap">Salamanca</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of the
gallantry displayed in that battle.</p>

<p>On the 23d of July the battalion was employed in
pursuit of the enemy by the route of Alba de Tormes,
and in August went into cantonments at Cuellar;
towards the end of that month it marched again, and
encamped before <em>Burgos</em>, which the Marquis of Wellington
(that title having been conferred upon him
after the victory at Salamanca) ordered should be
forthwith invested.</p>

<p>Major Molyneux Smith, of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, died
on the 21st of August 1812, and Brevet-Major John
Fox was appointed his successor on the 1st of October
following. The battalion took an active share in
all the operations against Burgos, from which the
British army retired on the 21st of October. The
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, during the siege, had seven rank and
file killed and eleven wounded.</p>

<p>After this most harassing retreat, rendered so by
the severity of the weather and the dreadful state of
the roads, as well as by a numerous and active-pursuing
enemy, the battalion, early in December, reached
Falgosa de Medelina, in Portugal, where it halted
for some weeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813.</div>

<p>In February 1813 the battalion marched from
Falgosa de Medelina to Toraish, where it remained
until May. There Lieut.-Colonel Davies, in consequence
of ill-health, left the corps for England, when
the command devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel John
Ward.</p>

<p>On the 14th of May the allied army again advanced,
crossed the Douro on the 19th, and halted on the 20th
at Toro de Monte Corva; on the 24th reached Malhadus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and halted until the 27th, and on the 29th
entered Spain by crossing the Corsa, near Murga,
where the troops, of which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> formed
part, halted until the 31st. On the 1st of June they
crossed the Esla by a pontoon bridge, and continued
the march until the 19th, when they halted at Madina
to observe General Clausel’s corps, and cover the
British stores and ammunition.</p>

<p>The battalion reached <em>Vittoria</em> on the 22d of June,
the day following the victory gained there by the
Marquis of Wellington, and halted at that place
during the 23d and 24th, still observing General
Clausel. On the 26th the battalion marched to
Mondragoa, and afterwards retrograded to Montinca,
whence Clausel was pursued to the bridge of Lagosa,
where the battalion arrived on the 30th of June; and,
marching again on the 1st of July, it encamped near
<em>Pampeluna</em> on the 5th of that month.</p>

<p>There the battalion halted until the 13th of July,
and on the following day it marched to Lanz, where
it remained until the 22d; and on the 23d it crossed
the Low Pyrenees to the valley of San Estevan; on
the 27th the battalion re-crossed the Pyrenees to
Torrossa.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July the battalion was in position
near <em>Pampeluna</em>, and was warmly engaged, the light
company under Captain William Campbell being detached
in smart skirmishing. On the following day
both armies remained quiet; but on the 30th of July
the battalion was again engaged early in the morning,
the light company being, as before, detached, under
Captain Campbell, to expel the enemy from the village
of <em>Sorauren</em>. About eight o’clock Major Martin
Leggatt arrived, and assumed the command, when
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Ward immediately proceeded
to join the light company in Sorauren. Marshal Soult
was however foiled, and about two o’clock in the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the enemy was in general retreat, being pursued
by the whole army.</p>

<p>In approbation of the conduct of Major Leggatt,
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Ward and Captain Campbell
on the three last-mentioned days, His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent, in the name and behalf of His
Majesty, was graciously pleased to present each of
them with a medal for the battles of the Pyrenees,
and to promote Captain Campbell to the brevet rank
of Major.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> subsequently received the Royal
Authority to bear on the regimental colour and appointments
the word “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>,” in commemoration
of the services of the first battalion in the actions which
occurred there, and which have been designated the
“<em>Battles of the Pyrenees</em>.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of August the battalion reached Bargetta,
and halted there until the 3d; on the following day it
pursued the enemy to the valley of Alduides; and on
the 5th and 6th the battalion was in position;&mdash;on the
7th it marched and encamped in the valley near Maya,
and on the 8th moved to the camp at the Pass of
Maya, where the battalion remained until the 9th of
September.</p>

<p>Major William Cross arrived at the camp of Maya
on the 10th of September, and resumed the command
of the battalion.</p>

<p>The battalion was present in the affair of <em>Urdax</em> on
the 7th of October, and had forty-six rank and file
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The British army was put in motion at an early hour
in the morning of the 10th of November, and advanced
to attack the enemy in his fortified position on the
<em>Nivelle</em>. In the battle which ensued, it was the proud
lot of the sixth division, of which the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
formed part, to charge and carry the enemy’s breastwork
and principal redoubt on the heights of <em>Ainhoa</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
with the loss of one drummer and five rank and file
killed.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Wellington, in his despatch of
the 13th of November, thus alluded to the conduct of
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> on this occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had the pleasure of seeing the sixth division
under Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton, after
having crossed the Nivelle, and having driven in
the enemy’s piquets on both banks, and having
covered the passage of the Portuguese division under
Lieut.-Colonel Sir John Hamilton, on its right,
<em>make a most handsome attack upon the right of the
enemy’s position behind Ainhoa, and on the right of
the Nivelle, and carry all the entrenchments, and the
redoubt on that flank</em>. Lieut.-General Sir John
Hamilton, supported with the Portuguese division,
the sixth division on its right, and both co-operated
in the attack of the second redoubt, which was
immediately carried.”</p>
</div>

<p>In this battle the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> had Captains
Robert Blakeney and William Gillam, Lieutenants
Thomas L’Estrange and William Tunstall, Ensigns
James McCabe and John Skerry, one serjeant and fifty-eight
rank and file, wounded.</p>

<p>Major Cross, for his services on this day, was promoted
to the brevet rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and
was with Brevet-Major Campbell honoured with the
medal for the battle of the Nivelle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> subsequently received the Royal
Authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>” on the regimental
colour and appointments, in commemoration of
the gallantry of the first battalion in that battle.</p>

<p>After this victory the battalion was in cantonments
at Usteritz, on the river <em>Nive</em>, observing the enemy,&mdash;who
was in force on the opposite side,&mdash;until the 9th of
December, when the passage of the river was forced,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and the battle of the <em>Nive</em> ensued. In the passage of
the Nive the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> had only three rank and
file wounded.</p>

<p>The enemy having failed in all his attacks, with his
whole force, on the British left, withdrew into his entrenchments
on the night of the 12th of December, and
passed a large force through Bayonne, with which, on
the morning of the 13th, he made a most desperate
attack on the troops under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill; the Marquis of Wellington, in expectation of this
attack, had given orders that the Lieut.-General should
be reinforced with the sixth division, which crossed the
Nive at daylight on that morning. The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
were accordingly in position at <em>Bidart</em>, but Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill defeated the enemy with
the troops under his own immediate command on the
13th of December, with immense loss, before the arrival
of the reinforcement, although the march of the sixth
division afforded him great facility in making his
movements.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the operations connected with
the passage of the river <em>Nive</em>, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> subsequently
received the Royal Authority to bear the
word “<span class="smcap">Nive</span>” on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>On the 14th of December the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> occupied
cantonments at Ville Franque, and commenced
the severe duty of the blockade of <em>Bayonne</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814.</div>

<p>The battalion was employed on this duty until the
21st of February 1814, on which day the army advanced,
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> being selected by Lieut.-General
Sir Henry Clinton, K.B., for the important duty of
protecting the artillery of the division from an apprehended
attack upon it by the enemy’s garrison of St.
Jean Pied de Port, which the dreadful state of the
roads obliged it nearly to pass. This obstacle fortunately
surmounted, by forced marches the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></span>
rejoined the army on the 26th of February, and shared
in the battle of <em>Orthes</em> on the following day.</p>

<p>On the day previous to the battle the third division
forded the river Gave de Pau, and a pontoon bridge
was afterwards laid at Bereaux, by which the fourth
and sixth divisions crossed on the morning of the 27th,
at which time the third division was already posted
with skirmishers thrown out close upon the left centre
of the French position. The sixth division, of which
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> formed part, was placed on the
right between the third division and the river, and the
light division on its left in rear as a reserve. During
the whole morning there had been occasional skirmishing
by the third division, but the real attack commenced at
nine o’clock by the third and sixth divisions on the
French left centre, and the fourth and seventh divisions
on their right, which last was intended to be the
principal point of attack; but it having been found,
after three hours’ hard fighting, that the enemy was
there too strongly posted, the Marquis of Wellington
ordered an advance of the third and sixth divisions,
with the Fifty-second regiment, from the centre upon
the left centre of the French position, which they
carried, and thus secured the victory; while Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill, with the second division, had
crossed the river above <em>Orthes</em>, and nearly cut off the
only line of retreat open to the enemy, who then
retired from the field, but without confusion, and
constantly resisting the advance. The allies followed,
keeping up an incessant fire and cannonade, but lost
many men, particularly of the third division, which
was the most strongly opposed; this continued
until the French nearly reached the Luy de Bearn
river, when their retreat became a flight, and they
effected their escape by the fords and one bridge,
which they destroyed, having lost four thousand men
and six guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>In commemoration of this victory, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
subsequently received the Royal Authority to bear the
word “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>” on the regimental colour and appointments.</p>

<p>The battalion shared in the affairs of <em>Vic Bigorre</em>
and <em>Tarbes</em> on the 19th and 20th of March. The
movement of the sixth division under Lieut.-General
Sir Henry Clinton is stated by the Marquis of
Wellington, in his despatch, to have been very ably
made, and it was completely successful.</p>

<p>During the night Marshal Soult retreated towards
<em>Toulouse</em>, followed on the 21st of March by the allies,
who continued their advance, until on the 26th they
arrived in presence of the French army. The town of
<em>Toulouse</em> is surrounded on three sides by the Canal of
Languedoc and the Garonne; on the left of that river,
the suburb, which the enemy had fortified with strong
field-works in front of the ancient wall, formed a good
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i>. The city itself was only accessible from
the south, and its strong though old-fashioned walls
had been rendered more defensible by redoubts, and
by an exterior line of entrenchments on a strong and
rugged range of heights, about two miles in length
beyond the canal. On the 28th the enemy’s troops were
driven within the suburb of St. Cyprien, and several
attempts were made to attack them by crossing the
Garonne above Toulouse. Operations were, however,
impeded by the floods and rapidity of the river, until
the 3d of April, when the third, fourth, and sixth
divisions, with three brigades of cavalry, under Marshal
Beresford, passed over by a pontoon bridge fifteen miles
below Toulouse; but the crossing of the remainder of the
army was again impeded by the rising of the river, which
caused the removal of the bridges, until the 8th, when
the Marquis of Wellington crossed, and advanced within
five miles of Toulouse; Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill, with two divisions, remaining on the left bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>In the battle of <em>Toulouse</em>, which began about six
o’clock in the morning of the 10th of April, it was the
good fortune of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> to commence the
attack of the sixth division. The Marquis of Wellington’s
plan of attack was for Marshal Sir William Beresford,
who was on the right of the Ers with the fourth
and sixth divisions, to cross that river at the bridge of
Croix d’Orade, to gain possession of Montblanc, and to
march up to the left of the Ers to turn the enemy’s
right, while Lieut.-General Don Manuel Freyre, with
the Spanish corps under his command, supported by the
British cavalry, attacked the front.</p>

<p>Marshal Sir William Beresford crossed the Ers,
formed his corps in three columns of lines in the village
of Croix d’Orade, and immediately carried Montblanc.
He then moved up the Ers in the same order,
over most difficult ground, in a direction parallel to the
enemy’s fortified position, and as soon as he reached the
point at which he turned it, he formed his lines, and
moved to the attack. The gallant efforts of Lieut.-General
Don Manuel Freyre did not meet with success,
but they were highly applauded by the Marquis of
Wellington. Meanwhile Marshal Sir William Beresford,
with the fourth division under the command of
Lieut.-General Sir Lowry Cole, and the sixth division
under Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton, attacked and
carried the heights on the enemy’s right, and the redoubt
which covered and protected that flank; and he
lodged those troops on the same heights with the enemy,
who were, however, still in possession of four redoubts,
and of the entrenchments and fortified houses.</p>

<p>The badness of the roads had induced the Marshal to
leave his artillery in the village of Montblanc; some
time elapsed before it could be brought up, and before
Lieut.-General Don Manuel Freyre’s corps could be
re-formed and led again to the attack. As soon as this
was effected, the Marshal continued his movement along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
the ridge, and earned, with Major-General Denis
Pack’s brigade of the sixth division, the two principal
redoubts and fortified houses in the enemy’s centre.
The enemy made a desperate effort from the canal to
regain these redoubts, but they were repulsed with
considerable loss; and the sixth division continuing its
movement along the ridge of the height, and the
Spanish troops continuing a corresponding movement
upon the front, the French were driven from the two
redoubts and entrenchments on the left, and the whole
range of heights were gained by the British.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Wellington, in his despatch,
added&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We did not gain this advantage, however, without
severe loss, particularly in the <em>brave sixth division</em>.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, Forty-second, Sixty-first, and
Seventy-ninth regiments lost considerable numbers,
and were highly distinguished throughout the day.</p>

<p>“I cannot sufficiently applaud the ability and conduct
of Marshal Sir William Beresford throughout
the operations of the day, nor that of Lieutenant-Generals
Sir Lowry Cole, Sir Henry Clinton, Major-Generals
Pack and Lambert, and the troops under
their command.</p>

<p>“The fourth division, although exposed on their
march along the enemy’s front in a galling fire, were
not so much engaged as the sixth division, and did
not suffer so much; but they conducted themselves
with their usual gallantry.”</p>
</div>

<p>By this last paragraph it is shown, that the sixth
division, of which the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment had for some time formed a part, bore
the brunt of this hard-fought, but, as it proved unnecessary,
battle.</p>

<p>The killed and wounded of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> were
one hundred and fifty-three, of all ranks, out of two
hundred and fifty; namely, Ensign James Cromie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
three serjeants and thirty-five rank and file killed,
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel William Cross, Brevet Major
William Campbell, Lieutenants James Prendergast,
Thomas L’Estrange, Peter Joseph Bone, William
Henry Robertson, and Edward Lewis, Ensigns Thomas
M. Taylor, and James McCabe, eight serjeants, and
ninety-seven rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Cross was so severely wounded
as to oblige him to be carried off the field, and the command
of the battalion devolved upon Major Martin
Leggatt.</p>

<p>In approbation of the services of Lieut.-Colonel Cross
at the battles of the Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse,
His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, in the name and
behalf of His Majesty, was graciously pleased to confer
upon that officer a cross, and to nominate him a Companion
of the Most Honourable Military Order of the
Bath; His Royal Highness was likewise pleased to
bestow on Major Leggatt a medal for the battle of
Toulouse.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> subsequently received the Royal
Authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Toulouse</span>” on the
regimental colour and appointments, in commemoration
of the distinguished gallantry of the first battalion in
that battle; also the word “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>” in testimony
of its services in Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th of April the French
troops evacuated <em>Toulouse</em>, and a white flag was hoisted.
On the following day the Marquis of Wellington
entered the city, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants.
In the course of the afternoon of the 12th of
April intelligence was received of the abdication of
Napoleon, and had not the express been delayed on the
journey by the French police, the sacrifice of many
valuable lives would have been prevented.</p>

<p>A disbelief in the truth of this intelligence occasioned
much unnecessary bloodshed at <em>Bayonne</em>, the garrison<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of which made a desperate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sortie</i> on the 14th of April,
and Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards Earl of
Hopetoun) was taken prisoner, Major-General Andrew
Hay was killed, and Major-General Stopford was
wounded. This was the last action of the Peninsular
war.</p>

<p>A Treaty of Peace was established between Great
Britain and France; Louis XVIII. was restored to the
throne of his ancestors; and Napoleon Bonaparte was
permitted to reside at Elba, the sovereignty of that
island having been conceded to him by the allied

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
embarked at Pouillac on the 22d of June 1814, and
arrived at the Cove of Cork on the 11th of the following
month, and subsequently proceeded to Kilkenny.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, which
had been employed on home duty during the Peninsular
War, was disbanded at Plymouth on the 24th of
October 1814, and the men fit for service were
transferred to the first battalion:&mdash;the detachment
accordingly embarked for Ireland on the 30th of
October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815.</div>

<p>The tranquillity which Europe appeared to have
gained by the splendid successes over the French in
the Peninsula, was again to be disturbed. Napoleon,
who had been accustomed to imperial sway, was naturally
discontented with his small sovereignty of Elba.
Besides, the correspondence kept up by him with his
adherents in France gave him hopes of regaining his
former power, which were, for a short time, fully
realized. Napoleon Bonaparte landed at Cannes, in
Provence, on the 1st of March 1815, with a small body
of men, and on the 20th of that month entered Paris
at the head of an army, which had joined him on the
road. This could not be matter of wonder, for the
officers and soldiers had won their fame under his command,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and gladly welcomed their former leader, under
whom they probably expected to acquire fresh honours,
which might cancel the memory of the defeats sustained
in the Peninsula and south of France.</p>

<p>Louis XVIII., unable to stem the torrent, withdrew
from Paris to Ghent, and Napoleon resumed his former
dignity of Emperor of the French. This assumption
the allied powers determined not to acknowledge, and
resolved to deprive him of his sovereignty, by again
restoring the ancient dynasty.</p>

<p>Napoleon was finally defeated on the plains of
Waterloo on the 18th of June 1815, and the allies
advanced on Paris. The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment embarked at Cork on the 3d of July,
and landed at Ostend on the 11th of that month. The
battalion marched from thence to Paris.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment remained in the neighbourhood
of Paris until December 1815, on the 22d of
which month it embarked at Calais for England; and,
landing at Dover and Ramsgate, it subsequently proceeded
to Portsmouth.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1816.</div>

<p>During the year 1816 the regiment was stationed at
Portsmouth.</p>

<p>Colonel the Honourable Basil Cochrane, who had
been serving as Assistant-Quartermaster-General in
Ireland, died on his passage from Newry to Liverpool
on the 14th of May 1816. Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
William Cross was appointed to succeed him as Lieut.-Colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on the 23d of
May, and Brevet Major William Wright Swain was
promoted to the vacant majority.</p>

<p>The word “<span class="smcap">Firm</span>” being an old regimental acquirement,
it was deemed necessary to apply to
Sir George Nayler, York Herald, Inspector of Regimental
Colours, for its insertion on the new colours
which had been prepared, when the following reply
was received:&mdash;</p>

<p>The regiment embarked at Portsmouth for the
Mediterranean on the 29th of July 1817, and landed
at Malta on the 27th of September following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818.</div>

<p>On the 4th of April 1818 General George Don was
removed from the Ninety-fifth (afterwards disbanded)
to the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, in succession to General
the Honourable Henry St. John, deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820.</div>

<p>The head-quarters of the regiment, with six companies,
embarked at Malta on the 5th of December 1820,
and landed in the island of Zante on the 11th of the
same month, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Cross, having left four companies at Malta under the
command of Major Swain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1821.</div>

<p>On the 18th of June 1821 the four companies which
had remained at Malta embarked for the island of
Cephalonia, where they arrived on the 22d of the same
month. The head-quarters and four companies embarked
at Zante on the 8th of July, and arrived at
Cephalonia on the 10th of that month, when Lieut.-Colonel
Cross assumed the command; two companies
were left detached at Zante under the command of
Brevet Major Henry Vernon.</p>

<p>On the 1st of November 1821 a detachment of the
regiment, consisting of one captain, three subalterns,
four serjeants, two drummers, and one hundred rank
and file, was ordered to proceed to the island of Cerigo,
under the command of Brevet Major William Campbell,
on a particular service.</p>

<p>During the five latter months of the regiment being
stationed at Cephalonia, the numbers of sick were very
great; so much so, that it was deemed indispensably
necessary to establish a convalescent hospital, as also
forming a detachment of two subalterns, two serjeants,
and eighty rank and file, principally consisting of the
most weakly soldiers that could be selected, which
proceeded to Fort St. George, a healthy eminence
situated about five miles from Argostoli, where the
head-quarters were stationed; another hospital was
also established there for the reception of the sick of
that detachment, under the superintendence of a medical
staff officer.</p>

<p>The increase of disease in this island was principally
attributed to the unconcentrated position of the
barracks, which were small, crowded, and temporary,
situated on a marsh in a valley close to the beach,
together with the insalubrious atmosphere, which
prevailed exceedingly during the time the regiment was
stationed there. The loss of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> by sickness
here was sixteen in two months, which consisted
principally of the stoutest young men in the regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>His Excellency the Commander of the Forces in the
Mediterranean, Lieut.-General the Right Honorable
Sir Thomas Maitland, G.C.B., having arrived at this
island early in November, and perceiving the debilitated
state of the corps, was pleased to direct its removal;
six days previously to which the two companies under
the command of Brevet Major Vernon arrived from
Zante and joined the head-quarters. On the 30th of
November the regiment, with the exception of the
detachment at Cerigo, embarked for Corfu, where
it arrived on the 4th of December, and occupied part
of the barracks in the citadel, and the whole of the
barracks and quarters in Fort Neuf; the head-quarters
and three companies in the latter, and the remaining
companies in the citadel; soon after which Lieut.-Colonel
Cross, having been a considerable time in a
bad state of health, obtained leave of absence; and
Major Swain, through domestic calamities, being
absent, the command devolved on Brevet Major
Joshua Crosse. Here Lieutenant Henry O’Bré died
on the 13th of December, about which time Brevet
Major Vernon was appointed Commandant of Paxo,
where he died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822.</div>

<p>Brevet Major Crosse was succeeded in the command
by Brevet Major Campbell, on his arrival from Cerigo
in the month of February 1822.</p>

<p>In March following Major Edmond Browne arrived
from England and took the command of the regiment,
he having succeeded to the majority by exchange from
the half-pay with Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Leggatt in
May 1821.</p>

<p>On the 2d June 1822 Major-General Sir Frederick
Adam, K.C.B., commanding, was pleased to order the
head-quarters and three companies stationed at Fort
Neuf to join the remaining companies at the citadel,
as well as the regimental hospital to be established
there, which was productive of much comfort to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
corps, together with the unremitting and unwearied
attention of the medical department, as well as at their
solicitation to send a portion of the men that had not
quite recovered from the diseases contracted at Cephalonia,
to the sick depôt formed at Malta, which was
acceded to, and they accordingly embarked for that
station on the 8th of August, where they arrived on
the 13th of the same month. This arrangement was
attended with the fortunate result of restoration to
their former good health; and, upon the 27th of
October following, two serjeants and forty-two rank
and file arrived from Malta in His Majesty’s ship
“Cambrian;” and at subsequent dates others arrived,
leaving only a very few bad cases at Malta; so that afterwards
it generally had the fewest sick of any regiment
in the Ionian Islands, or in the Mediterranean.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1823.</div>

<p>On the 1st of February 1823, the detachment which
was stationed at Cerigo arrived at Corfu, and joined the
head-quarters of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825.</div>

<p>In the year 1825, the establishment of the regiment
was augmented from eight to ten companies, and
formed into six <em>service</em> and four <em>depôt</em> companies, consisting
of forty-two serjeants, fourteen drummers, and
seven hundred and forty rank and file.</p>

<p>The regiment remained in the Ionian Islands until
the 2d of December 1825, when it embarked at Santa
Maura for England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826.</div>

<p>On the 18th of February 1826, the regiment disembarked
at Chatham; in the spring it proceeded to
Colchester, afterwards to Macclesfield, Stockport, Manchester,
and Bolton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827.</div>

<p>During the early part of the year 1827, the regiment
remained at Bolton, in Lancashire, and in April it proceeded
to Liverpool, from which place it embarked for
Ireland on the 14th of that month. The regiment
arrived at Dublin on the following day, proceeded
from thence to Mullingar, and returned to Dublin in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
August following, where it was stationed during the
remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1828.</div>

<p>In May 1828, the regiment proceeded from Dublin
to Naas, and in October it was removed to Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829.</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Limerick until August
1829, when it proceeded to Birr, and continued during
the rest of the year at that station.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, Bart., was
appointed Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on
the 21st of December 1829, in succession to General
Sir George Don, G.C.B. and G.C.H., removed to the
Third foot, or the Buffs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830.</div>

<p>In June 1830, the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment proceeded
from Birr to Fermoy, and was formed into six
<em>service</em> and four <em>depôt</em> companies. The service companies
embarked at Cork on the 11th, 13th, and 14th
of October for the West Indies. The depôt companies
remained at Fermoy for a short time, and were afterwards
stationed at Spike Island.</p>

<p>The service companies disembarked at Barbadoes on
the 20th, 21st, and 28th of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831.</div>

<p>The service companies suffered severely during the
great hurricane in Barbadoes in 1831, having eleven
men killed, and several severely injured.</p>

<p>The depôt companies were removed from Spike
Island to Charles Fort, Kinsale, in October 1831, and
continued there during 1832.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833.</div>

<p>The service companies which had, since their
arrival in the West Indies, remained at Barbadoes,
were removed to Antigua in February 1833. The
depôt companies proceeded from Charles Fort to Ballincollig
in January 1833; to Cork in February; to
Templemore in August, and to Nenagh in October
following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834.</div>

<p>During the year 1834, the service companies remained
at Antigua. The depôt companies were removed
in October from Nenagh to Limerick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1835.</div>

<p>In November 1835 the service companies proceeded
from Antigua to St. Lucia. The depôt companies
quitted Limerick for Galway in May 1835, and
marched for Cork in June following, where they embarked
for Plymouth on the 14th of September;
during the remainder of the year they were stationed
at Devonport.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1836.</div>

<p>During the year 1836, the service companies remained
at St. Lucia, and the depôt at Devonport.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1837.</div>

<p>In February 1837 the service companies proceeded
from St. Lucia to Barbadoes.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1838.</div>

<p>The depôt companies were removed from Devonport
to Kinsale in June 1838.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November 1838, the service companies
embarked at Barbadoes for Nova Scotia, and
arrived at Halifax on the 8th of December.</p>

<p>The following extract of a letter to the Adjutant-General

the year at Fredericton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>The depôt companies were removed from Kinsale to

<div class="sidenotex">1840.</div>

<p>During the year 1840 the service companies were

<div class="sidenote">1842.</div>

<p>On the 29th of April 1842, the service companies
embarked at St. John’s for Ireland, and arrived at Cork
on the 28th of May, where they were consolidated with
the depôt companies.</p>

<p>In August the regiment proceeded from Cork to
Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1843.</div>

<p>The regiment was removed, in July 1843, from

<div class="sidenotex">1844.</div>

<p>In July 1844, the regiment proceeded from Dublin
to Newry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845.</div>

<p>The regiment embarked at Newry for Great Britain
on the 24th of April 1845; arrived at Whitehaven on
the 28th of that month; and proceeded to Newcastle-on-Tyne.</p>

<p>Colonel Archibald Montgomery Maxwell, K.H., died
at Newcastle-on-Tyne on the 21st of May 1845, and
Major Charles Ashmore was promoted Lieut.-Colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment from the 22d of May.
Captain Edward R. King was promoted to the vacant
majority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846.</div>

<p>In 1846 the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment was augmented
to sixty-seven serjeants, twenty-five drummers, and
twelve hundred rank and file. It was also ordered to
be formed into two battalions of six companies each.
In May the regiment proceeded from Newcastle-on-Tyne
to Manchester, and in August it was removed to
Weedon, where on the 28th of November the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
was divided into two battalions. While quartered at
Weedon the regiment received new colours, which were
presented by Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Arbuthnot,
K.C.B., commanding the northern and midland
districts of South Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847.</div>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Charles Ashmore,
embarked at Gosport in Her Majesty’s troop ship “Resistance”
for the Ionian Islands, on the 6th of January
1847; the reserve battalion, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Charles Trollope, who had been promoted
to that rank on the augmentation of the regiment,
also embarked at Gosport for the Mediterranean, on the
2d of that month, in the “Vengeance” ship of war.</p>

<p>The head-quarters and three companies of the first
battalion disembarked at Argostoli, in the island of
Cephalonia, on the 8th of February. Two companies
were detached to the island of Zante, and one to Ithaca.</p>

<p>The reserve battalion disembarked at Corfu on the
31st of January.</p>

<p>The depôt of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment formed
part of the depôt battalion at the Isle of Wight, on the
embarkation of the two battalions for foreign service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848.</div>

<p>The detachment of the first battalion at Zante proceeded
from thence on the 6th of May 1848, leaving
one field officer, one captain, two subalterns, four serjeants,
and ninety-six rank and file with the head-quarters
at Cephalonia, the remainder proceeding to
Corfu. The detachment at Cerigo was moved from
thence to Corfu on the 13th of May 1848. The head-quarters
and five companies of the first battalion proceeded
from Cephalonia to Corfu on the 3d of August.</p>

<p>One company of the reserve battalion was detached
at Vido from the 24th of March to the 19th of July
1848, and one company at Ithaca from the 15th of
July to the 5th of October 1848. The reserve battalion
proceeded from Corfu to Cephalonia on the 2d of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
August 1848. On the 26th of September an attack
was made on the town of Argostoli by several hundred
armed Villani, which was repelled by Serjeant Luke
Dunn and twelve men of the battalion, the resident’s
guard on that morning, with the loss of two killed and
two wounded. Privates Daniel McNamara and William
Elsom killed; privates Thomas Fox and James Lidwell
wounded; several others received shots through their
caps, clothing, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the same day a detachment of fifty men, under
Major Lorenzo Rothe, Captain James Nugent, and
Lieutenant Rickard Lloyd, succeeded in saving the
public records at Lixuri, as they were on the point of
being destroyed by a party of insurgents, who fired on,
and slightly wounded, two soldiers; the detachment
returned the fire, wounded some of the insurgents,
and drove them from the town.</p>

<p>The reserve battalion was engaged for ten or twelve
days and nights in guarding the towns of Argostoli and
Lixuri, during which period the sentries and guards
were repeatedly fired upon and otherwise annoyed by
the insurgents. A party under Ensign Bernard Robert
Shaw succeeded in capturing Cappoletto, one of the
principal rebels, for whose arrest a reward of fifteen
hundred dollars had been offered. Detachments of
fifty men, each under Captain Alexander McGeachy
Alleyne and Ensign George Massy Robins, and Lieutenant
Cecil Rivers and Ensign John Edmund Harvey,
were sent to the southern part of the island to scour
the district of Scala.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1849.</div>

<p>Two companies of the first battalion, consisting of
one captain, four subalterns, six serjeants, two drummers,
and one hundred and fifty rank and file, under the
command of Major Edward R. King, proceeded to
Cephalonia on the 30th of August 1849, for the purpose
of suppressing an insurrection in that island, and
returned to Corfu on the 17th of November following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Two companies of the reserve battalion, under
Captain Charles Wilson Carden, were, in February,
employed in aid of the civil power at St. Gerasimo for
the purpose of enforcing payment of the fines inflicted
on the villages concerned in the insurrection of the 26th
of September of the previous year; this party returned
to head-quarters on the 26th of February. A company
under Captain James Nugent likewise proceeded to St.
Gerasimo in May 1849 in aid of the civil power, and
to assist in pursuit of banditti; it rejoined the head-quarters
in August. A company under Captain John
Pratt proceeded in May to Scala in aid of the civil
power, and to assist in enforcing the embargo, and
rejoined the head-quarters on the 22d of June.</p>

<p>A company of the reserve battalion under Captain
Henry J. Coote was detached to Sissi on the 29th of
August in aid of the civil power, and was subsequently
employed in very arduous services under the proclamation
of martial law, which lasted from the 31st of
August, to the 27th of October 1849, and in suppressing
the outbreak in Cephalonia. Privates Taylor and Green
of this company were wounded in a skirmish with the
insurgents. A company under Lieutenant Rickard
Lloyd proceeded in September to Sissi to reinforce the
detachment under Captain Coote, and after serving in
conjunction therewith, returned to head-quarters with
it on the 15th of October. One company under
Captain Nugent proceeded to Faraclata on the 16th of
September, and assisted in the pursuit of the outlawed
rebels; a portion of this detachment, under Ensign
Alfred Macdonald, was employed as a flying column,
and scoured the country in chase of the three outlawed
rebel chiefs for twenty-three days, during the whole of
which time it was subjected to the most fatiguing
marches and labour. The reserve battalion during the
period of martial law from the 31st of August to the
27th of October 1849, which was administered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Lieut.-Colonel Trollope, was frequently employed in
pursuit of rebels (parties, varying from forty to a hundred,

guarding the town of Argostoli, the men having very
seldom more than one night in bed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1850.</div>

<p>In April 1850 it was directed that the regiment
should be reduced to a thousand rank and file; the
reserve battalion at Cephalonia was in consequence
broken up, and consolidated with the first battalion at
Corfu, where the regiment was stationed during this
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1851.</div>

<p>In March 1851, four companies embarked at Cephalonia
for England for the purpose of forming the depôt,
which was afterwards stationed at the Isle of Wight,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Trollope.</p>

<p>The service companies, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Ashmore, embarked at Corfu for the West
Indies on the 21st of March 1851 in the freight ship
“Java,” and arrived at Barbadoes on the 16th of May
following, where they were stationed during the remainder
of the year.</p>

<p>Major-General the Lord Frederick FitzClarence,
G.C.H., was appointed Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment on the 23d of July 1851, in succession to
General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, Bart., deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1852.</div>

<p>In May 1852 the service companies were removed
from Barbadoes to Trinidad.</p>

<p>The depôt companies proceeded in April 1852 from
Parkhurst to Fort Pembroke Dock.</p>

<p>On the 31st of December 1852, the date to which
this record has been brought, the service companies
continued to be stationed at Trinidad, and the depôt
companies at Fort Pembroke Dock.<br /><br /></p>

Spain, Charles VI., Emperor of Germany, died on the 20th of October
1740, and a contest arose in consequence of the succession of the Archduchess
Maria Theresa to his hereditary dominions being disputed by the
Electors of Bavaria and Saxony, and also by the Kings of Prussia and
Spain. The King of France, Louis XV., supported the Elector of
Bavaria, while King George II. supported the claims of the Archduchess
Maria Theresa. On the 27th of June 1743, King George II. gained a
victory over the French army at <em>Dettingen</em>, and in the following year,
Great Britain and France, no longer acting as auxiliaries, became principals
in the contest, which is designated the “<em>War of the Austrian
Succession</em>.”</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 28th June 1701.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Caulfeild</span>, the second Viscount Charlemont,
for his services in the cause of King William III., was rewarded
by a regiment of infantry. His Majesty also made
him Governor and Custos Rotulorum of the counties of
Tyrone and Armagh, and Governor of the fort of Charlemont.
Several regiments of infantry being ordered to be
disbanded in 1697, and his Lordship’s regiment being one
of them, His Majesty, in consideration of his faithful services,
directed the sum of eight shillings per day to be paid him
as half-pay, and on the 28th of June 1701, His Majesty again
appointed him to the command of a newly raised corps,
which is now the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment. On the 25th of
August 1704, his Lordship was promoted to the rank of
Brigadier-General, and in the following year was called
upon to serve in Spain under Charles, Earl of Peterborough.
Lord Charlemont rendered important services at the siege of
Barcelona; and at the attack of Fort Montjuich on the 14th
of September 1705, his Lordship marched into the works, at
the head of his men, and was near the Prince of Hesse
Darmstadt when he received the wound which terminated
mortally. After the action Lord Charlemont, and Lieut.-Colonel
Southwell of the Sixth foot, were presented to the
King of Spain as officers that had performed signal service
on that occasion, for which they received the thanks of that
Sovereign. The taking of this fort paved the way for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
reducing Barcelona, which surrendered on the 9th of October
1705. His Lordship was subsequently removed from the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, by the Earl of Peterborough, and,
in justice to his character and feelings, preferred a complaint
to Her Majesty Queen Anne against his former Commander;
this was referred to a Council of General Officers, who, after
several meetings, at which witnesses were heard on both
sides, made two satisfactory reports to Her Majesty, copies
of which are inserted at the end of this memoir. On the 1st
of January 1707 Queen Anne advanced him to the rank of
Major-General, and he was honoured with the confidence of
Her Majesty, as had been the case with King William III.,
both as a Peer, and in his military capacity. In May 1709,
his Lordship was one of the committee appointed to draw
up an address of condolence to Her Majesty on the decease
of Her Royal Consort Prince George of Denmark, and also
to congratulate the Queen on the success of her arms.</p>

<p>In May 1726, his Lordship was sworn of the Privy
Council to King George I., and after having enjoyed the
peerage upwards of fifty-five years, and being reputed the
oldest nobleman in the Kingdom, he died on the 21st of July
1726, and was buried at Armagh.</p>

Officers concerning the difference between the Earl of Peterborough
and Viscount Charlemont, alluded to in the foregoing
Memoir.</p>

<p>“We, the General Officers of the Army, in obedience
to your Majesty’s commands, have examined into the
Memorial of the Lord Viscount Charlemont, complaining of
hardships received from the Earl of Peterborough, in Spain,
in relation to his regiment, from which he alleged he had
been removed upon a pretended order from your Majesty;
and having fully heard what their Lordships had severally
to offer therewith with witnesses, and other testimony, as
were produced on both sides, on due debate and consideration
of the whole, we are humbly of opinion,&mdash;</p>

<p>“That it appears to this Board, that a pretended Order
from the Queen was made use of, to induce the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Charlemont to part with his regiment; and that there
have been indirect means used for the doing it.</p>

<p>“That it likewise appears to the Board, that the Earl of
Peterborough has not done anything irregular to compel
the Lord Charlemont to part with his regiment. All
which is most humbly submitted to your Majesty this 12th

to the General Officers of the Army a Petition of the Lord

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Thomas Alnutt.</span></p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 10th May 1706.</em></p>

<p>Upon Viscount Charlemont’s raising the corps which is
now numbered the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>, this officer was appointed
to a company in the regiment; and he embarked with it in
the expedition against Cadiz in 1702. Captain Alnutt subsequently
proceeded with the regiment to the West Indies;
and in 1704 returned with it to Ireland. His services are
also connected with the expedition to Spain under the Earl
of Peterborough in 1705, the siege of Barcelona in the same
year, and its gallant and successful defence against King
Philip in 1706. Lieut.-Colonel Alnutt, to which rank he
had been advanced at this period, was appointed Colonel of
the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on the 10th of May 1706, in
succession to the Viscount Charlemont. At the Battle of
Almanza on the 25th of April 1707, Colonel Alnutt was
wounded and taken prisoner. His decease occurred on the
7th of May 1708.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Archibald, Earl of Ilay</span>,<br />
afterwards<br />
<span class="smcap">Duke of Argyle</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 23d March 1709.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archibald</span>, third Duke of Argyle, was born at Ham, in
Surrey, in June 1682, and resided in England until he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
about seventeen years of age, when he was sent to the University
of Glasgow. From thence he went to Utrecht, and
made considerable advancement in the study of civil law,
intending to practise in that profession. Upon his father’s
advancement to the Dukedom of Argyle on the 23d of June
1701, his son Archibald embraced a military life, and served
under the Duke of Marlborough.</p>

<p>In 1705 he was constituted Lord High Treasurer of
Scotland, and in the Parliament of that year, in which his
brother John, who had succeeded his father as Duke of
Argyle two years previously, presided as Lord High Commissioner,
he sat and voted as such upon the Queen’s letter;
he was nominated one of the Commissioners for the Treaty
of Union in 1706, and on the 19th of October of that year
was created by patent, dated at Kensington, Earl and Viscount
of Ilay, Lord Oransay, Dunoon, and Arrase. This
nobleman was one of the sixteen representatives of the
Scottish peerage, chosen by Parliament on the 13th of
February 1707, and was re-chosen at every general election
until his decease, with the single exception of the last
Parliament of Queen Anne’s reign.</p>

<p>The Earl of Ilay, upon his brother’s resignation, was, on
the 1st of June 1708, sworn and admitted one of the extraordinary
Lords of Session, being, says Fountainhall, “the
best school of law for the nobility to learn that is in Europe.”
On the 23d of March 1709 Her Majesty Queen Anne appointed
the Earl of Ilay to be Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment. The governorship of Dumbarton Castle was also
conferred upon his Lordship.</p>

<p>Finding that a statesman’s career was more congenial to
his taste than the military profession, he quitted the army
and resigned the colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
in 1710. With his accustomed assiduity his Lordship
employed himself in the acquisition of political knowledge.
In 1710 he was appointed Lord Justice General of Scotland,
and was sworn a Privy Councillor in the following year.
Upon the accession of George I. the Earl of Ilay was constituted
Lord Clerk Register; and on the breaking out of
the rebellion in 1715 he again betook himself to arms in
defence of the reigning family. By his prudent conduct
in the Western Highlands he prevented General Gordon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
at the head of three thousand men, from penetrating into
the country and raising levies. He joined his brother the
Duke of Argyle on the 13th of November 1715, half an
hour before the battle of Sheriffmuir, where he was wounded.</p>

<p>In 1725 this nobleman received the office of Keeper of
the Privy Seal, and in December 1733 his Lordship was
appointed Keeper of the Great Seal. Upon the decease
of his brother, in 1743, the Earl of Ilay became third Duke
of Argyle, and Hereditary Justiciary of Argyleshire and the
Western Islands. After the suppression of the rebellion in
1746, he carried into effect the judicious plan of employing
the Highlanders in the Royal army, which had been suggested
by the Right Honourable William Pitt, afterwards
the Earl of Chatham.</p>

<p>The Duke of Argyle continued at the head of affairs in
Scotland, in full possession of his mental faculties, until his
death, which happened in London, without a moment’s pain,
as he was sitting in his chair at dinner, on the 15th of April
1761, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. On this nobleman’s
decease the title of Earl of Ilay became extinct; his
other titles and estates in Scotland descended to his cousin,
Lieut.-General John Campbell of Mamore, Colonel of the
Second dragoons, or Scots Greys.</p>

under the orders of Lord Dorchester, and with
instructions from Lieut.-Governor Simcoe, on a public
mission to protest against certain settlements made by the
Americans on the south shore of Lake Ontario. On the
5th of May 1795, he was promoted to the rank of Captain
in the Fifth fusiliers, and on the 13th of December 1797
was promoted Major in the Eighty-first regiment, and was
advanced to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel of the Forty-ninth
regiment on the 22d of March 1798.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Sheaffe served in Holland from August to
November 1799; in the Baltic from March to July 1801;

the 25th of April 1808, he received the brevet rank of
Colonel, and on the 4th of June 1811 was advanced to the
rank of Major-General. He again served in Canada from
the 29th of July 1812 to November 1813. The Americans
having invaded Upper Canada at Queenstown on the 13th
of October 1812, and General Brock, commanding in the
province, having fallen in a gallant effort with an independent
force to oppose them, Major-General Sheaffe, on whom
the command devolved, assembled some regular troops and
militia, with a few Indians, and the same day attacked
them in a woody height, which they occupied above the
town, and completely defeated them, though far exceeding
his own followers in number, their Commander delivering
his sword, and surrendering his surviving troops on the
field of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>In acknowledgment of this important service, Major-General
Sheaffe was created a Baronet by patent, dated
16th January 1813. Sir Roger Sheaffe defended the town
of York (now called Toronto), in Upper Canada, on the
27th of April 1813, when it was attacked by the Americans,
whose loss exceeded the number of those opposed to them.
He continued to command in the Upper Province, and to
administer its government, until June 1813; on quitting
it he received, from the resident members of the Executive
Council, an address expressing their sense of “that display
of candour, justice, and impartiality which had marked his
administration, and the urbanity and confidence of his
official intercourse.” They further acknowledged their
conviction that they owed the salvation of the whole province
to his military talents on the memorable day when
he succeeded to the command. He was appointed to the
Staff of Great Britain on the 25th of March 1814; but
the appointment was recalled and deferred, in consequence
of the change of affairs in Europe.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Roger Sheaffe was promoted to the

<p>“After I wrote to you yesterday morning we were
attacked by the whole of the French army, Sir Harry
Burrard being still on board ship, and I gained a complete
victory. It was impossible for troops to behave
better than our’s did: we only wanted a few hundred more
cavalry to annihilate the French army.</p>

<p>“I have sent my Report upon this action to Sir Harry
Burrard, who will send it home. You will see in it that
I have mentioned Colonel Burne of the 36th regiment
in a very particular manner, and I assure you that there
is nothing that will give me so much satisfaction as to
learn that something has been done for this old and
meritorious soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“Sir Harry did not land till late in the day in the midst
of the attack, and he desired me to continue my own
operations; and, as far as I am personally concerned in
the action, I was amply rewarded for any disappointment
I might have felt in not having had an opportunity of
bringing the service to a close, by the satisfaction expressed
by the army that the second and more important
victory had been gained by their old General.</p>

<p>“I have also the pleasure to add, that it has more effect
than all the argument I could use to induce the General
to move on, and I believe he will march to-morrow.
Indeed, if he does not, we shall be poisoned here by the
stench of the dead and wounded, or we shall starve, everything
in the neighbourhood being already eaten up.</p>

<p>“From the number of dead Frenchmen about the ground,
and the number of prisoners and wounded, I should think
their loss could not be far short of 3,000 men. The force
which attacked us was very respectable, and probably not
short of 14,000 men, including 1,300 dragoons and
artillery, and 300 <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseurs à cheval</span>.</p>

whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may
employ, there is inherent in the British officers and
soldiers a bravery that knows not how to yield, that no
circumstances can appal, and that will ensure victory when
it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General has the greatest satisfaction in distinguishing
such meritorious services as came within his
observation, or have been brought to his knowledge.</p>

<p>“His acknowledgments are, in a peculiar manner, due to
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, and the brigade
under his command, consisting of the fourth, forty-second,
and fiftieth regiments, and which sustained the weight of
the attack.</p>

<p>“Major-General Manningham, with his brigade, consisting
of the Royals, the twenty-sixth and eighty-first regiments,
and Major-General Warde, with the brigade of
Guards, will also be pleased to accept his best thanks for
their steady and gallant conduct during the action.</p>

<p>“To Major-General Paget, who, by a judicious movement
of the reserve, effectually contributed to check the progress
of the enemy on the right; and to the first battalion of
the fifty-second and ninety-fifth regiments, which were
thereby engaged, the greatest praise is justly due.</p>

<p>“That part of Major-General Leith’s brigade which was
engaged, consisting of the fifty-ninth regiment, under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
conduct of the Major-General, also claims marked approbation.</p>

<p>“The enemy not having rendered the attack on the left
a serious one, did not afford to the troops stationed in that
quarter an opportunity of displaying that gallantry which
must have made him repent the attempt.</p>

<p>“The piquets and advanced posts, however, of the brigades
under the command of Major-Generals Hill and
Leith, and Colonel Catlin Craufurd, conducted themselves
with determined resolution, and were ably supported by
the officers commanding these brigades, and by the troops
of which they were composed.</p>

<p>“It is peculiarly incumbent upon the Lieut.-General
to notice the vigorous attack made by the second battalion
of the fourteenth regiment under Lieut.-Colonel Nicolls,
which drove the enemy out of the village, of the left of
which he had possessed himself.</p>

<p>“The exertions of Lieut.-Colonel Murray, Quartermaster-General,
and of the other officers of the General Staff,
during the action, were unremitted, and deserve every
degree of approbation.</p>

<p>“The illness of Brigadier-General Clinton, Adjutant-General,
unfortunately deprived the army of the benefit
of his services.</p>

<p>“The Lieut.-General hopes the loss in point of numbers
is not so considerable as might have been expected;
he laments, however, the fall of the gallant soldiers and
valuable officers who have suffered.</p>

<p>“The Lieut-General knows that it is impossible, in any
language he can use, to enhance the esteem, or diminish
the regret, that the army feels with him for its late Commander.
His career has been unfortunately too limited
for his country, but has been sufficient for his own fame.
Beloved by the army, honored by his Sovereign, and
respected by his country, he has terminated a life devoted
to her service by a glorious death,&mdash;leaving his name as a
memorial, an example, and an incitement to those who
shall follow him in the path of honor, and it is from his
country alone that his memory can receive the tribute
which is its due.</p>

<p>“The benefits derived to an army from the example of a
distinguished Commander do not terminate at his death;
his virtues live in the recollection of his associates, and
his fame remains the strongest incentive to great and
glorious actions.</p>

<p>“In this view the Commander-in-Chief, amidst the deep
and universal regret which the death of Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore has occasioned, <ins class="corr" id="tn-126" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'recals to the troops'">
recalls to the troops</ins> the
military career of that illustrious officer for their instruction
and imitation.</p>

<p>“Sir John Moore from his youth embraced the profession
with the feelings and sentiments of a soldier; he
felt that a perfect knowledge and an exact performance
of the humble but important duties of a subaltern officer
are the best foundations for subsequent military fame,
and his ardent mind, while it looked forward to those
brilliant achievements for which it was formed, applied
itself with energy and exemplary assiduity to the duties
of that station.</p>

<p>“In the school of regimental duty he obtained that
correct knowledge of his profession so essential to the
proper direction of the gallant spirit of the soldier, and
he was enabled to establish a characteristic order and
regularity of conduct, because the troops found in their
leader a striking example of the discipline which he enforced
on others.</p>

<p>“Having risen to command, he signalised his name in
the West Indies, in Holland, and in Egypt. The unremitting
attention with which he devoted himself to the
duties of every branch of his profession obtained him
the confidence of Sir Ralph Abercromby, and he became
the companion in arms of that illustrious officer, who
fell at the head of his victorious troops in an action
which maintained our national superiority over the arms
of France.</p>

<p>“Thus Sir John Moore at an early period obtained,
with general approbation, that conspicuous station in
which he gloriously terminated his useful and honorable
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“In a military character obtained amidst the dangers of
climate, the privations incident to service, and the sufferings
of repeated wounds, it is difficult to select any one
point as a preferable subject for praise; it exhibits, however,
one feature so particularly characteristic of the man,
and so important to the best interests of the service, that
the Commander-in-Chief is pleased to mark it with his
peculiar approbation&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The life of SIR JOHN MOORE was spent among
the troops.</span></p>

<p>“During the season of repose his time was devoted to
the care and instruction of the officer and soldier; in war
he courted service in every quarter of the globe. Regardless
of personal consideration, he esteemed that to which
his country called him <em>the post of honor</em>, and by his
undaunted spirit and unconquerable perseverance he
pointed the way to victory.</p>

<p>“His country, the object of his latest solicitude, will
rear a monument to his lamented memory, and the Commander-in-Chief
feels he is paying the best tribute to
his fame by thus holding him forth as an <span class="allsmcap">EXAMPLE</span> to the
<span class="allsmcap">ARMY</span>.</p>

<p>“I was favoured with your note and the enclosure
last night, but in one part, as it does not exactly meet the
facts, I have taken the liberty of enclosing you a certificate,
which, from the conversation I have had with the
Colonel, I think will. It is not in the power of the
Colonel to certify that they positively have borne the
word ‘<span class="smcap">Firm</span>’ on the colours; but he has every reason to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
believe so, as the bearings of the colours are usually on
the regimental seals of regiments. The Colonel has been
in the regiment thirty-seven years, and the oldest officer
by very many years now remaining in it. During his
time the regiment must have had three pairs of regimental
colours;&mdash;the pair when the regiment returned
from the West Indies, I presume, now entirely worn out
and destroyed; the pair on the regiment’s return from
the East Indies was, from the same cause, burned at
Winchester; and the present pair of colours consists
of as many rags as might form the size of a silk handkerchief,
but not a piece that is whole six inches square.
These rags are tied together round the staff. Therefore,
concluding that the former colours were before disposed
of, at least in as bad a state as those, it would become
impossible to say what bearings or mottoes might have
been upon the pair when Colonel Burne joined, which
was on their return from the West Indies, to which is
to be added the great mortality and change among
officers who served at that time in those climates. I
should have had the pleasure of waiting upon you this
day upon the subject, but as I leave town to-morrow I am
compelled to confine my business to writing. May I,
therefore, beg the additional favour (should the certificate
meet your approbation, or any other form that may accord
with the fact stated) that you will enclose it to my brother,
who will forward it to me? I feel extremely anxious to
get the business completed as soon as possible, the regiment
being again down for service, &amp;c., which I trust, in
your goodness, will plead as my apology for intruding so
much upon your time.</p>

<p>“I Robert Burne, Lieut.-Colonel of the first battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, a Colonel in the army, and
Governor of His Majesty’s garrison of Carlisle, do hereby
certify and declare, that during the space of <em>thirty-seven
years</em> to my own positive knowledge, and how long
previous thereto I cannot set forth, the said regiment has
used on its regimental seal the word ‘<span class="smcap">Firm</span>;’ and that I
verily believe, by reason thereof, the said regiment to be
entitled to bear the same upon its colours, and that the
said word may have lapsed and been forgotten by the
frequent change of officers and the mutilated or almost
destroyed state in which the colours of the regiment have
been on their return from service, and that I am, therefore,
extremely anxious that the said word ‘<span class="smcap">Firm</span>’ should be
inscribed in the painting of the colours of the aforesaid
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment, now preparing, by His Majesty’s
command, under the inspection of George Nayler, Esquire,
York Herald, and Inspector of Regimental Colours. In
witness whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name,
and affixed the seal of the said regiment, at Battle,
Sussex, this fifth day of April one thousand eight hundred
and ten.</p>

<p class="negin1"><em>Memoir of the services of Lieut.-General Robert Burne,
formerly Lieut.-Colonel of the</em> <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> <em>regiment</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Burne</span> entered the army as Ensign in the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>,
his commission being dated 28th of September 1773;
and it is remarkable that he obtained all his regimental
promotions in that corps. On the 13th of January 1777 he
was advanced to the rank of Lieutenant. On the 10th of
March 1783 Lieutenant Burne embarked with the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment for Madras, and arrived in that Presidency
in July following. In 1784 he succeeded to the Captain-Lieutenancy,
and on the 7th of May of that year was appointed
Captain of a company in the regiment. Upon the
army taking the field against Tippoo Saib he was Captain of
the Grenadier company. Captain Burne was in the battles
of Sattimungulum and Shawoor on the 13th and 14th of
September 1790, and was afterwards at the storming of the
pettah and fort of Bangalore in March 1791. Captain
Burne served at the attack of Nundydroog in October 1791;
he was also present in the operations before Seringapatam
during the night of the 6th of February 1792, under General
the Earl Cornwallis, which compelled Tippoo to enter
into a treaty of peace with the British. He was at the
siege and capture of Pondicherry in August 1793; and on
the 1st of March 1794 he was promoted to the brevet rank
of Major, which rank he attained in the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment
on the 15th of April 1796. On the 1st of January
1798 Major Burne was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel by
brevet, and he embarked at Madras in command of the
<span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment on the 15th of October, but did
not arrive in England until July 1799, the want of convoy
having caused the Indiamen to be detained three months at
St. Helena.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November 1799 Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Burne was appointed Lieut.-Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span>
regiment, with which he embarked, in the year 1800, for
the coast of France, with the expedition under Brigadier-General
the Honorable Sir Thomas Maitland; he afterwards
proceeded with his regiment to Minorca, from which
island, in 1801, he was compelled, by severe illness, to return
to England for the recovery of his health, being the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
time he was ever absent from the regiment. Upon the conclusion
of the peace of Amiens in 1802 Minorca was restored
to the Spaniards, and the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> returned to Ireland,
when Lieut.-Colonel Burne resumed the command of the
regiment.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Burne embarked with the first battalion of
the regiment for Germany in October 1805, and returned
with it to England in March following. In November 1806
he proceeded with the first battalion of the regiment on the
expedition to South America under Brigadier-General
Robert Craufurd; and in June 1807 landed in that country;
was with the advance of the army at the operations in the
suburbs of Buenos Ayres on the 2d, 3d, and 4th of July;
and also shared in the attack on the town of Buenos Ayres
on the 5th of July.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment embarked
at Buenos Ayres in September, and arrived at Cork
in December 1807. On the 25th of April 1808 Lieut.-Colonel
Burne was promoted by brevet to the rank of
Colonel, and in July following embarked with the first
battalion for the Peninsula. Colonel Burne was present at
the battles of Roleia and Vimiera on the 17th and 21st of
August 1808. Lieut.-General the Honourable Sir Arthur
Wellesley in his despatch particularly noticed the conduct
of Colonel Burne and that of the battalion. On the 8th of
September following Colonel Burne was appointed Governor
of Carlisle by His Majesty King George III. After these
services Colonel Burne proceeded in command of the
battalion with the troops destined to join Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore at Salamanca, and was present at the battle
of Corunna on the 16th of January 1809; after which he
embarked with the army for England. Colonel Burne, for
his services at Roleia, Vimiera, and Corunna, received the
honorary distinction of a medal and clasp.</p>

<p>On the 16th of July 1809 Colonel Burne embarked in
command of the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-sixth</span> regiment,
with the expedition to the Scheldt, and served in August at
the siege and capture of Flushing, in the island of Walcheren.
He was afterwards appointed Colonel on the staff
at that place, where he continued until the evacuation of
the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Burne was appointed a Brigadier-General on the
staff in Portugal on the 21st of January 1811, and landed
in the Peninsula prior to the retreat of the French army
from Santarem, and was present at the battle of Fuentes
d’Onor on the 3d and 5th of May, together with the other
operations in which the sixth division of the army was
engaged. On the 4th of June 1811 he was advanced to
the rank of Major-General, and continued on the staff in the
Peninsula until the 24th of April 1812, when he returned to
England; and, on the 25th of June following, was appointed
to the staff of Great Britain, and was ordered to take the
command of the camp near Lichfield; upon the breaking
up of that encampment Major-General Burne was ordered
to the command of the Nottingham district, where he
remained on the staff until the 24th of September 1814.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July 1821 Major-General Burne was
advanced to the rank of Lieutenant-General. His decease
occurred in June 1825.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
